Moving from the Paleolithic age to the present, Karen Armstrong details the great lengths to which humankind has gone in order to experience a sacred reality that it called by many names, such as God, Brahman, Nirvana, Allah, or Dao. Focusing especially on Christianity but including Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Chinese spiritualities, Armstrong examines the diminished impulse toward religion in our own time, when a significant number of people either want nothing to do with God or question the efficacy of faith. Why has God become unbelievable? Why is it that atheists and theists alike now think and speak about God in a way that veers so profoundly from the thinking of our ancestors? Answering these questions with the same depth of knowledge and profound insight that have marked all her acclaimed books, Armstrong makes clear how the changing face of the world has necessarily changed the importance of religion at both the societal and the individual level. Yet she cautions us that religion was never supposed to provide answers that lie within the competence of human reason; that, she says, is the role of ""logos."" The task of religion is ""to help us live creatively, peacefully, and even joyously with realities for which there are no easy explanations."" She emphasizes, too, that religion will not work automatically. It is, she says, a practical discipline: its insights are derived not from abstract speculation but from ""dedicated intellectual endeavor"" and a ""compassionate lifestyle that enables us to break out of the prism of selfhood.""",The Bodley Head,Jonathan Cape,Theology,Atheism,,106393,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5ng0PQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,101,ISBN

In The Jesus Papers, Michael Baigent reveals the truth about Jesus's life and tackles controversial questions, such as whether or not there is incontrovertible proof that Jesus Christ survived the crucifixion. Twenty years ago Michael Baigent and his colleagues stunned the world with a controversial theory that Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene married and founded a holy bloodline. His bestselling book Holy Blood, Holy Grail (with co-authors Henry Lincoln and Richard Leigh) became an international publishing phenomenon and was one of the sources for Dan Brown's novel The Da Vinci Code. Now, with two additional decades of research behind him, Baigent's The Jesus Papers presents explosive new evidence that challenges everything we know about the life and death of Jesus. Who could have aided and abetted Jesus and why? Where could Jesus have done after the crucifixion? What is the truth behind the creation of the New Testament? Who is working to keep the truth buried and why? explored, studied, and in some instances excavated for the first time, Baigent provides a detailed account of his groundbreaking discoveries, including many never-before-seen photos.",Harper Element,HarperThorsons,Christianity,Christianity,,106293,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KzFUAAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,101,ISBN

Also explored are how Mason's political beliefs prompted him to turn his creative energies to left-wing theater movements in the 1930s, the impact that family pressures had on his life, and his late-in-life diagnosis with manic depression.",Victoria University Press,Victoria University Press,"Biography / Mason, R.A.K.",Biography & Autobiography,,101213,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4rCG5EwxW_4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,101,ISBN

Over three centuries, approximately one hundred thousand persons, most of whom were women, were put to death under the guise of ""witch hunts"", particularly in Reformation Europe. The shocking annihilation of women from all walks of life is explored in this brilliant, authoritative feminist history Anne Llwellyn Barstow. Barstow exposes an unrecognized holocaust -- the ""ethnic cleansing"" of independent women in Reformation Europe -- and examines the residual attitudes that continue to influence our culture. Barstow argues that it is only with eyes sensitive to gender issues that we can discern what really happened in the persecution and murder of these women. Her sweeping chronicle examines the scapegoating of women from the ills of society, investigates how their subjugation to sexual violence and death sent a message of control to all women, and compares this persecution of women with the enslavement and slaughter of African slaves and Native Americans. Ultimately Barstow traces the current backlash against women to its gynophobic torture-filled origins. In the process, she leaves an indelible mark on our growing understanding of the legacy of violence against women around the world.",HarperCollins,Harper Collins,Witchcraft / Europe,Social Science,Paperback,102604,10,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=knzm_3oe9TcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,101,ISBN

Baur posed, in inescapably sharp form, a question which has haunted Christianity throughout its history: is Christianity simply a form of Judaism, development from Judaism, or was it, as Baur argued, from the beginning something quite distinct, a religious spirit or consciousness which could not be or become itself until it broke through the limits and restrictions of its historical origins? Baur's radical answer set the agenda for the rest of the nineteenth century, and though neglected for most of the twentieth century, the question has reemerged with renewed force in a post-Holocaust world.""--James D.G. Dunn, Emeritus Lightfoot Professor of Divinity, University of Durham ""It will be extremely helpful to New Testament critics to have F.C. Baur's influential work on Paul-long out of print and often no longer even available on most theological library shelves-conveniently at hand. Baur's application of Hegel's dialectical theories to the writings of Paul profoundly shaped the discourse of his mid-nineteenth century German contemporaries, including that of those who sought to challenge certain aspects of his interpretation. They did not escape the powerful force of his conceptualization of the world, including a deeply negative evaluation of the Oriental spirit (i.e., Judaism and Jewishness), which was central to his project. The legacy of these developments-the so-called Tubingen school-has deeply influenced NT studies (and arguably world history) ever since, and continues to assert its influence on the interpretation of Paul's voice to this day, although often now in unrecognized ways. With the availability of this edition, that is about to change.""-Mark D. Nanos, author of The Galatians Debate, The Irony of Galatians, and The Mystery of Romans ""Perhaps the most influential book of nineteenth-century New Testament scholarship, Paul the Apostle of Jesus Christ offered a novel, breathtaking synthesis of the apostle's place in the development of early Christianity. ... In seeking the authentic writings of Paul, the generative center of his thought, the role of the Law and its relationship to the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the historical value of the book of Acts, and the views of Paul's opponents, Baur's work set an agenda that continues to dominate modern inquiry.""-A. Andrew Das, Niebuhr Distinguished Chair, professor of religious studies, Elmhurst College ""The history of Pauline and even New Testament studies is a continuing dialogue with the assumptions and conclusions of Ferdinand Christian Baur. No Pauline scholar-recent efforts notwithstanding-has so shaped the set of questions asked of Paul's letters as did Baur. This is not to say that Baur got it right-far from it. He was no doubt wrong, and sometimes quite wrong, on a number of crucial issues in each of the areas that he so significantly influenced. Nevertheless, his legacy regarding the influence of fundamental conflicts in the early church, and the need for critical rather than simply theological scrutiny of the letters, is still of importance as we continue to study Paul's letters in the context of the New Testament and early Christianity.""-Stanley E.

Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan,Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan,Herbert P. Bix,Herbert P. Bix,2000,2001-09-04,0060931302,"0060931302, 9780060931308",812,150,,"Winner of the Pulitzer Prize In this groundbreaking biography of the Japanese emperor Hirohito, Herbert P. Bix offers the first complete, unvarnished look at the enigmatic leader whose sixty-three-year reign ushered Japan into the modern world. Never before has the full life of this controversial figure been revealed with such clarity and vividness. Bix shows what it was like to be trained from birth for a lone position at the apex of the nation's political hierarchy and as a revered symbol of divine status. Influenced by an unusual combination of the Japanese imperial tradition and a modern scientific worldview, the young emperor gradually evolves into his preeminent role, aligning himself with the growing ultranationalist movement, perpetuating a cult of religious emperor worship, resisting attempts to curb his power, and all the while burnishing his image as a reluctant, passive monarch. Here we see Hirohito as he truly was: a man of strong will and real authority. Supported by a vast array of previously untapped primary documents, Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan is perhaps most illuminating in lifting the veil on the mythology surrounding the emperor's impact on the world stage. Focusing closely on Hirohito's interactions with his advisers and successive Japanese governments, Bix sheds new light on the causes of the China War in 1937 and the start of the Asia-Pacific War in 1941. And while conventional wisdom has had it that the nation's increasing foreign aggression was driven and maintained not by the emperor but by an elite group of Japanese militarists, the reality, as witnessed here, is quite different. Bix documents in detail the strong, decisive role Hirohito played in wartime operations, from the takeover of Manchuria in 1931 through the attack on Pearl Harbor and ultimately the fateful decision in 1945 to accede to an unconditional surrender. In fact, the emperor stubbornly prolonged the war effort and then used the horrifying bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, together with the Soviet entrance into the war, as his exit strategy from a no-win situation. From the moment of capitulation, we see how American and Japanese leaders moved to justify the retention of Hirohito as emperor by whitewashing his wartime role and reshaping the historical consciousness of the Japanese people. The key to this strategy was Hirohito's alliance with General MacArthur, who helped him maintain his stature and shed his militaristic image, while MacArthur used the emperor as a figurehead to assist him in converting Japan into a peaceful nation. Their partnership ensured that the emperor's image would loom large over the postwar years and later decades, as Japan began to make its way in the modern age and struggled -- as it still does -- to come to terms with its past. Until the very end of a career that embodied the conflicting aims of Japan's development as a nation, Hirohito remained preoccupied with politics and with his place in history. Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan provides the definitive account of his rich life and legacy. Meticulously researched and utterly engaging, this book is proof that the history of twentieth-century Japan cannot be understood apart from the life of its most remarkable and enduring leader.",HarperCollins,Harper Collins,Hirohito / Japan,History,Paperback,100512,15,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zjxCLxj78tkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,101,ISBN

The boring debate between fundamentalist believers and non-believers is finally moved on by Alain de Botton's inspiring new book, which boldly argues that the supernatural claims of religion are of course entirely false - and yet that religions still have some very important things to teach the secular world. Religion for Atheists suggests that rather than mocking religions, agnostics and atheists should instead steal from them - because they're packed with good ideas on how we might live and arrange our societies. Blending deep respect with total impiety, de Botton (a non-believer himself) proposes that we should look to religions for insights into, among other concerns, how to: Build a sense of community Make our relationships last Overcome feelings of envy and inadequacy Escape the twenty-four hour media Go travelling Get more out of art, architecture and music And create new businesses designed to address our emotional needs. For too long non-believers have faced a stark choice between either swallowing lots of peculiar doctrines or doing away with a range of consoling and beautiful rituals and ideas.

And yet, influential as this phenomenon is in the worldview of so many, the belief in biblical prophecy remains a popular mystery, largely unstudied and little understood. When Time Shall Be No More offers for the first time an in-depth look at the subtle, pervasive ways in which prophecy belief shapes contemporary American thought and culture. Belief in prophecy dates back to antiquity, and there Paul Boyer begins, seeking out the origins of this particular brand of faith in early Jewish and Christian apocalyptic writings, then tracing its development over time. Against this broad historical overview, the effect of prophecy belief on the events and themes of recent decades emerges in clear and striking detail. Nuclear war, the Soviet Union, Israel and the Middle East, the destiny of the United States, the rise of a computerized global economic orderâe""Boyer shows how impressive feats of exegesis have incorporated all of these in the popular imagination in terms of the Bibleâe(tm)s apocalyptic works. Reflecting finally on the tenacity of prophecy belief in our supposedly secular age, Boyer considers the direction such popular conviction might takeâe""and the forms it might assumeâe""in the postâe""Cold War era. The product of a four-year immersion in the literature and culture of prophecy belief, When Time Shall Be No More serves as a pathbreaking guide to this vast terra incognita of contemporary American popular thoughtâe""a thorough and thoroughly fascinating index to its sources, its implications, and its enduring appeal.",Harvard University Press,Belknap Press,Theology,History,,106296,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Q7EZnwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,101,ISBN

The synoptic nature of the discussion makes it ideal as the foundation of an undergraduate course in the philosophy of mind.",Blackwell Publishers,Wiley-Blackwell,Philosophy of Mind,Philosophy,Paperback,100572,40,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ltvSNPW0ziwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,101,ISBN

Bradshaw maintains that Shakespeare was preoccupied with the question throughout his career, and the plays themselves show how opposing visions of nature yield opposing accounts of value. He believes that Shakespeare's skepticism in respect to value represents a mode of dramatic thinking, which depends on the practices and conventions of poetic drama and must be distinguished from the processes of logical discursive argument.--From publisher description.",Cornell University Press,,Shakespeare,Drama,Paperback,100586,18.95,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eeVPAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,101,ISBN

There is little public enthusiasm for reversing the reforms. once one of the most regulated OECD economies, New Zealand is now one of the least regulated. Unemployment has recently fallen sharply. The estimated sustainable growth rate of real GDP is now 3-3half per cent. The transformation of New Zealand - from a protectionist, regulated society with 'cradle-to-grave' welfare to an open, market-based economy operating under the rule of law - has a 'Hayekian flavour'. Under the guidance of Roger (now Sir Roger) Douglas, New Zealand adopted a 'big bang' approach to reform, though the pace of reform slackened from a time in the late 1980s. Micro-economic reforms included removal of controls on wages, prices, and foreign exchange and floating of the New Zealand dollar. Import quotas have been removed and tariffs reduced.

Baird Callicott's decade-long effort to articulate, defend, and extend the seminal environmental philosophy of Aldo Leopold. A leading voice in this new field, Callicott sounds the depths of the proverbial iceberg, the tip of which is ""The Land Ethic."" ""The Land Ethic,"" Callicott argues, is traceable to the moral psychology of David Hume and Charles Darwin's classical account of the origin and evolution of Hume's moral sentiments. Leopold adds an ecological vision of organic nature to these foundations. How can an evolutionary and ecological environmental ethic bridge the gap between is and ought? How may wholes--species, ecosystems, and the biosphere itself--be the direct objects of moral concern? How may the intrinsic value of nonhuman natural entities and nature as a whole be justified? In addition to confronting and resolving these distinctly philosophical queries, Callicott engages in lively debate with proponents of animal liberation and rights--finally to achieve an integrated theory of animal welfare and environmental ethics. He critically discusses the land ethic that is alleged to have prevailed among traditional American Indian peoples and points toward a new and equally revolutionary environmental aesthetic.",SUNY Press,SUNY Press,Ecology / Philosophy,Philosophy,Hardback,103038,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nouQwAOipZsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,101,ISBN

The medieval world was not simply excavated through systematic research. It had to be conceptually created: It had to be invented, and this is the story of that invention. Norman Cantor focuses on the lives and works of twenty of the great medievalists of this century, demonstrating how the events of their lives, and their spiritual and emotional outlooks, influenced their interpretations of the Middle Ages. Cantor makes their scholarship an intensely personal and passionate exercise, full of color and controversy, displaying the strong personalities and creative minds that brought new insights about the past. A revolution in academic method, this book is a breakthrough to a new way of teaching the humanities and historiography, to be enjoyed by student and general public alike. It takes an immense body of learning and transmits it so that readers come away fully informed of the essentials of the subject, perceiving the interconnection of medieval civilization with the culture of the twentieth century and having had a good time while doing it! This is a riveting, entertaining, humorous, and learned read, compulsory for anyone concerned about the past and future of Western civilization.",Quill,Harper Perennial,Middle Ages / Historiography,History,Paperback,100173,14,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ISOEDzIblbsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,101,ISBN

The editors and their fifteen contributors are drawn from a variety of scholarly backgrounds—including anthropology, ethnology, psychotherapy and art history. This diversity of approach is responsible for the book's unique character, a reflection of the multiplicity of symbols and signs and the phenomenal range of possible interpretations they offer. This book draws together folklore, literary and artistic sources, and focuses on the symbolic dimension of every colour, number, sound, gesture, expression or character trait that has benefitted from symbolic interpretation. The conscious and unconscious minds are explored, desire and dreams are treated alongside the known and the chronicled.

Until recently, no one ever managed to leave the country. No organized, active opposition movement exists, either at home or abroad. Western historians and researchers have had little access to information about North Korea apart from official Party documents and propaganda. This book marks the first time that a victim of the regime, a survivor and escapee, has provided a personal and documented insight into the labor camps, the organized famine, the farcical trials, the repression, and the political conditioning within this ""hermit kingdom.""Kang Chol-Hwan was arrested at the age of nine along with other members of his family when his grandfather made remarks about life in a capitalist country that were judged to be too complimentary. He grew up in the camps and has escaped to South Korea to document his personal life as a testimonial to the hardships and atrocities that constitute the lives of some several hundred thousand people living in the gulag today. Kang's account of his internment reveals the life-and-death conditions of the camp, the relentless forced labor, and the mental repression that drove the two hours of daily ""political training"" that followed twelve hours of backbreaking work. His memoir documents the political bartering of food and the ""ideological"" uses of malnutrition. Part horror story, part historical document, part memoir, part political tract, this book brings together unassailable firsthand experience, setting one young man's personal suffering in the wider context of modern history.",Basic Books,Basic Books,North Korea,History,Paperback,106553,34.95,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ssh_zgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,101,ISBN

This new edition incorporates the striking developments that have taken place in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence and notes their expanding relevance to philosophical issues. Churchland organizes and clarifies the new theoretical and experimental results of the natural sciences for a wider philosophical audience, observing that this research bears directly on questions concerning the basic elements of cognitive activity and their implementation in real physical systems. (How is it, he asks, that living creatures perform some cognitive tasks so swiftly and easily, where computers do them only badly or not at all?) Most significant for philosophy, Churchland asserts, is the support these results tend to give to the reductive and the eliminative versions of materialism.

As Vatican Secretary of State, Pacelli signed an agreement with Hitler in 1933 that protected the power of the Catholic Church in exchange for their complete withdrawal from politics. This act proved fatal. When he became Pope Pius XII, he continually refused to condemn the Nazis - even though he was one of the first European leaders to be made aware of the Final Solution. And even when Italian Jews were rounded up under the walls of the Vatican and transported to the death camps. His failure to criticize Nazism, especially when seen in the light of his patent anti-Semitism, is one of the great scandals of wartime.

Few resisted or rebelled and their efforts prolonged the war. Their failure to translate leading-edge expertise into military success is a crucial feature of world history.

Such a survey is badly needed, the author argues, because so many of the attacks on Don Cupitt are misplaced and fail to see his ongoing project as a whole. Scott Cowdell divides Cupitt into 'the early Cupitt', up to Taking Leave of God; 'the later Cupitt', the writer of the trilogy consisting of Taking Leave of God, The World to Come and Only Human and of The Sea of Faith; and the most recent non-realist Cupitt of The Long-Legged Fly. While sympathetic to Don Cupitt's works Scott Cowdell is by no means uncritical, and makes some important objections, particularly to Cupitt's rejection of alternative approaches: 'there are more thing in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in his philosophy'. But at least, he argues, Don Cupitt is honest in his assertions; there are other theologians in effect just as radical who conceal their radical character in an obscurantist haze.

Science is now on the verge of answering our most profound questions about the nature of existence. Here Paul Davies explains how the far-reaching discoveries of recent physics are revolutionizing our world and, in particular, throwing light on many of the questions formerly posed by religion, such as: Why is there a universe? Where did we come from? What is life? How is the world organized? Examining subjects from the creation to the soul, free will to time, black holes to miracles, he travels through science and religion to show us that there is more to the world than meets the eye.

Davis' position (widely held, but seldom articulated) is that the standard of medical care is an even higher ideal than the redress of past racial injustice. A passionate battle is now being fought in our universities over the freedom to pursue ideals of objectivity and intellectual freedom that are incompatible with the mandates of a pragmatic social policy. Storm Over Biology examines many of the areas where scientific and social interests intersect and often conflict, such as genetic engineering and sociobiology. The essays are grouped under six headings: Genetics, Racism and Affirmative Action; Objectivity and Science; Evolution - Sociobiology, Ethics, and Molecular Genetics; Medical Education and Affirmative Action; Public Concern Over Science; and Genetic Engineering. Though trained and best known as a microbiologist, Bernard D. Davis addresses these issues philosophically.

Within weeks it became the most hotly debated topic, with Dawkins himself branded as either saint or sinner for presenting his hard-hitting, impassioned rebuttal of religion of all types. His argument could hardly be more topical. While Europe is becoming increasingly secularized, the rise of religious fundamentalism, whether in the Middle East or Middle America, is dramatically and dangerously dividing opinion around the world. In America, and elsewhere, a vigorous dispute between 'intelligent design' and Darwinism is seriously undermining and restricting the teaching of science. In many countries religious dogma from medieval times still serves to abuse basic human rights such as women's and gay rights. And all from a belief in a God whose existence lacks evidence of any kind. Dawkins attacks God in all his forms. He eviscerates the major arguments for religion and demonstrates the supreme improbability of a supreme being. He shows how religion fuels war, foments bigotry and abuses children.

Mysteries don't lose their poetry because they are solved: the solution often is more beautiful than the puzzle, uncovering deeper mysteries. With the wit, insight, and spellbinding prose that have made him a best-selling author, Dawkins takes up the most important and compelling topics in modern science, from astronomy and genetics to language and virtual reality, combining them in a landmark statement of the human appetite for wonder.

In strong opposition to the popular view that success is determined by cultural differences, de Soto finds that it actually has everything to do with the legal structure of property and property rights. Every developed nation in the world at one time went through the transformation from predominantly extralegal property arrangements, such as squatting on large estates, to a formal, unified legal property system. In the West we've forgotten that creating this system is what allowed people everywhere to leverage property into wealth. This persuasive book revolutionized our understanding of capital and points the way to a major transformation of the world economy.",Basic Books,Basic Books,Capitalism,Business & Economics,,101073,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2rICGIigx0UC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,101,ISBN

A still unsurpassed catalogue of sexual perversions and the first systematic exploration of the psychopathology of sex, it was written during Sade's lengthy imprisonment for sexual deviancy and blasphemy and then lost after the storming of the Bastille during the French Revolution in 1789. Later rediscovered, the manuscript remained unpublished until 1936 and is now introduced by Simone de Beauvoir's landmark essay, 'Must We Burn Sade?' Unique in its enduring capacity to shock and provoke, The 120 Days of Sodom must stand as one of the most controversial books ever written, and a fine example of the Libertine novel, a genre inspired by eroticism and anti-establishmentarianism, that effectively ended with the French Revolution.",Arrow,,Literature,Fiction,,101072,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QEj2wAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,101,ISBN

Working with only a fraction of the materials available to today's classical scholar, Fustel de Coulanges fashioned a complete picture of life in the ancient city, resulting in a book impressive today as much for the depth of its portrait as for the thesis it presents. In The Ancient City, Fustel argues that primitive religion constituted the foundation of all civic life. Developing his comparisons between belifes and laws, Fustel covers such topis as rites and festivals; marriage and the family; divorce, death, and burial; and political and legal structures. ""Religion,"" the suthor states, ""constituted the Greek and Roman family, established marriage and paternal authority, fixed the order of relationship, and consecrated the right of propery, and the right of inheritance. This same religion, after having enlarged and extended the family, formed a stull larger association, the city, and reigned in that as it had reigned in the family. From it came all the institutions, as well as the private law, of the ancients."" As Arnaldo Momigliano and S. C. Humphreys note in their foreword, The Ancient City rightly takes its place alongside a number of pioneering works of the late nineteenth century that offered radically new inerpretations of ancient society and culture. Indeed, modern anthropology, as well as classics, owes a debt to Fustel de Coulanges, whose early insights in The Ancient City remain valid and provocative today.",The John Hopkins University Press,,History,History,,101066,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QEVoAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,101,ISBN

These are the words Charles Darwin uttered when he revealed to the world what he knew to be true: that humans are descended from headless hermaphrodite squids. How could a wealthy gentleman, a stickler for respectability, attack the foundations of his religion and Anglican society? Authors Adrian Desmond and James Moore, in what has been hailed as the definitive biography of Charles Darwin, not only explain the paradox of the man but bring us the full sweep of Victorian science, theology, and mores. The authors unveil the battle over the mind and soul that raged around the student Darwin as well as his drunken high-life in prostitute-ridden Cambridge. They vividly re-create Darwin's five-year voyage on the Beagle and his struggle to develop his theory of evolution. Then, they follow Darwin through his decades of torment. Fully aware that his ideas could bring ruin and social ostracism to his beloved family, Darwin kept his thoughts secret for twenty years. Seeming to lead an ideal squire's life in rural Kent, he was actually a man ""living in Hell,"" plagued by trembling, vomiting, and violent cramps and confronted by personal tragedy that left him grief-stricken for the rest of his life. But even more than Marx and Freud, this anguished man was to transform the way we see ourselves on this planet. Desmond and Moore's rich, comprehensive, and unparalleled portrait of his life contains a wealth of newly transcribed and unpublished letters, a thorough understanding of all available Darwin research, and ninety photographs, many never published before. Its lively and accessible style makes each chapter as gripping to read as a novel, yet the legitimacy and importance of this seminal work is never diminished--providing the whole story of how Darwin came to his world-changing conclusions and how, when the Origin of Species was finally published, its consequences were far more dramatic than Darwin's worst fears ... and wildest dreams.",Michael Joseph,,"Biography / Darwin, Charles",Biography & Autobiography,Paperback,101080,20,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BuLaAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,101,ISBN

Dyson,1999,1999,0195139224,"0195139224, 9780195139228",124,0,,"In this visionary look into the future, Freeman Dyson argues that technological changes fundamentally alter our ethical and social arrangements and that three rapidly advancing new technologies--solar energy, genetic engineering, and world-wide communication--together have the potential to create a more equal distribution of the world's wealth. Dyson begins by rejecting the idea that scientific revolutions are primarily concept driven. He shows rather that new tools are more often the sparks that ignite scientific discovery. Such tool-driven revolutions have profound social consequences--the invention of the telescope turning the Medieval world view upside down, the widespread use of household appliances in the 1950s replacing servants, to cite just two examples. In looking ahead, Dyson suggests that solar energy, genetics, and the Internet will have similarly transformative effects, with the potential to produce a more just and equitable society. Solar power could bring electricity to even the poorest, most remote areas of third world nations, allowing everyone access to the vast stores of information on the Internet and effectively ending the cultural isolation of the poorest countries. Similarly, breakthroughs in genetics may well enable us to give our children healthier lives and grow more efficient crops, thus restoring the economic and human vitality of village cultures devalued and dislocated by the global market. Written with passionate conviction about the ethical uses of science, The Sun, the Genome, and the Internet is both a brilliant reinterpretation of the scientific process and a challenge to use new technologies to close, rather than widen, the gap between rich and poor.",Oxford University Press,New York Public Library Lectur,Science History,Science,Paperback,101136,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WOGbGQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,101,ISBN

Why this is so and what we should do about it is the subject of this book. Between contemporary emphasis on grievances and the fears engendered by 9/11, today it is common to hear it said that life has started downhill, or that our parents had it better. But objectively, almost everyone in today's United States or European Union lives better than his or her parents did. Still, studies show that the percentage of the population that is happy has not increased in fifty years, while depression and stress have become ever more prevalent. The Progress Paradox explores why ever-higher living standards don't seem to make us any happier. Detailing the emerging science of ""positive psychology,"" which seeks to understand what causes a person's sense of well-being, Easterbrook offers an alternative to our culture of crisis and complaint. He makes a Compelling case that optimism, gratitude, and acts of forgiveness not only make modern life more fulfilling but are actually in our self-interest. Seemingly insoluble problems of the past, such as crime in New York City and smog in Los Angeles, have proved more tractable than they were thought to be. Likewise, today's ""impossible"" problems, such as global warming and Islamic terrorism, can be tackled too. Like The Tipping Point, this book offers an affirming and constructive way of seeing the world anew. The Progress Paradox will change theway you think about your place in the world, and about our collective ability to make it better.",Random House,Random House (NY),Progress / Quality of Life,Current Events,,101138,47.95,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GOztAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,101,ISBN

In this highly accessible book, Bart Ehrman reviews the latest textual and archeological research into Jesus's life and the history of first-century Palestine, and draws a fascinating, controversial portrait of the man and his teachings. Jesus, Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium seeks to show general readers what historians have long known about the Gospels and the man who stands behind them. Through a careful evaluation of the New Testament Gospels and other surviving sources, including the more recently discovered Gospels of Thomas and Peter, Ehrman proposes that Jesus can be best understood as an apocalyptic prophet, a man convinced that the world would end dramatically within his lifetime, and that a new kingdom would be created on earth--a just and peaceful kingdom ruled by a benevolent God. According to Ehrman, Jesus's belief in a coming apocalypse and his expectation of an utter reversal in the world's social organization underscores not only the radicalism of his teachings, but also sheds light on both the appeal of his message to society's outcasts and the threat he posed to the established leadership in Jerusalem. In this sharply-written and persuasive book, Ehrman suggests that the apocalyptic fervor that perpetually grips large segments of society is nothing new. Indeed, history's many doomsayers, including those today who are frantic about the approaching millennium, are close in spirit and thinking to Jesus, who waited in vain for the imminent arrival of a new kingdom of peace.",Oxford University Press,Oxford University Press on Demand,Theology,Religion,,103122,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lGnQtAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,101,ISBN

He argues that proto-orthodox scribes of the second and third centuries occasionally altered their sacred texts for polemical reasons--for example, to oppose adoptionists like the Ebionites, who claimed that Christ was a man but not God.

'What's he really like?' Wherever I went and was introduced as Spike Milligan's manager I waited for the inevitable question. In not far short of thirty-six years it never altered. It wasn't one that could be answered in a few words so I generally made do with 'Interesting' or 'don't ask'... After chancing on an advertisement for a secretarial position, Norma Farnes found herself initiated into the world of Number Nine Orme Court where Spike and some of post-war's other greatest comedy writers like Eric Sykes, Johnny Speight, Ray Galton and Alan Simpson had formed a writers' cooperative. Soon promoted to be his manager, Norma was working for a man with a reputation for being brilliant and difficult in equal measure. Spike's life from his childhood and extraordinary family in India, his ongoing battle with his restless mind, his numerous affairs and his heartening struggles with many varied causes. She gives a mass of wonderful anecdotes and revealing insights into Spike and his circle, including, of course, his often fraught but deep friendship with Peter Sellers. In Spike, Norma Farnes has written a moving portrait of her greatest friend. Above all, Spike's fascinating, very human character is brought to life on every page.",Harper Perrenial,HarperPerennial,"Milligan, Spike",Comedians,,106287,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9_3NOQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,101,ISBN

In understanding the true nature of what it means to be fully human, Feuerbach contends that we come face to face with the essence of Christian theology: human beings investing ordinary concepts with divine meaning and significance. The true danger to humanity occurs when theology is given the force of dogma and doctrine. Losing sight of its anthropological underpinnings and dependence upon or emergence from human nature, it then acquires an existence separate from that of humankind. Feuerbach leaves nothing untouched: miracles, the Trinity, Creation, prayer, resurrection, immortality, faith and much more.

Now thirteen years old, Zlata began her diary just before her eleventh birthday, when there was peace in Sarajevo and her life was that of a bright, intelligent, carefree young girl. Her early entries describe her friends, her new skis, her family, her grades at school, her interest in joining the Madonna Fan Club. And then, on television, she sees the bombs falling on Dubrovnik. Though repelled by the sight, Zlata cannot conceive of the same thing happening in Sarajevo. When it does, the whole tone of her diary changes. Early on, she starts an entry to ""Dear Mimmy"" (named after her dead goldfish): ""SLAUGHTERHOUSE! MASSACRE! HORROR! CRIMES! BLOOD! SCREAMS! DESPAIR!"" We see the world of a child increasingly circumscribed by the violence outside. Zlata is confined to her family's apartment, spending the nights, as the shells rain down mercilessly, in a neighbor's cellar. And the danger outside steadily invades her life. No more school. Living without water and electricity. Food in short supply. The onslaught destroys the pieces she loves, kills or injures her friends, visibly ages her parents. In one entry Zlata cries out, ""War has nothing to do with humanity. War is something inhuman"". In another, she thinks about killing herself. Yet, with indomitable courage and a clarity of mind well beyond her years, Zlata preserves what she can of her former existence, continuing to study piano, to find books to read, to celebrate special occasions - recording it all in the pages of this extraordinary diary.",Penguin Group,Viking Adult,Autobiography,Biography & Autobiography,Hardback,103133,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=h0lpAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,101,ISBN

Analyzing the ways that philosophers have tried to get around these difficulties, Flew distinguishes three main hypotheses. The 'reconstitutionist way' maintains that after death, flesh-and-blood people are miraculously reconstituted as the same flesh-and-blood people. The 'way of the astral body' maintains that at death, similarly structured but normally undetectable 'astral bodies' detach themselves from the flesh-and-blood people they once were. The 'Platonic-Cartesian way,' by far the most frequently proffered view, maintains that people essentially are their incorporeal minds or souls, and that these detach themselves from their bodies at death. The main problem, says Flew, is that of logically demonstrating how a person surviving death in any imagined altered state could identify him- or herself as the same person who had previously lived. Flew reviews both the classic arguments of Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, and Descartes, as well as the modern findings of parapsychology, and in doing so he elucidates this complex issue with logical rigor and engaging wit.""--front and back flaps.",Prometheus Books,,Philosophy / Immortality,"Body, Mind & Spirit",Hardback,101243,59.95,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TD_XAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,101,ISBN

From an intensive study of the Moses legend, Freud comes to the startling conclusion that Moses himself was an Egyptian who brought from his native country the religion he gave to the Jews. He accepts the hypothesis that Moses was murdered in the wilderness, but that his memory was cherished by the people and that his religious doctrine ultimately triumphed. Freud develops his general theory of monotheism, which enabled him to throw light on the development of Judaism and Christianity.",Vintage,Vintage,Judaism,Religion,,104960,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cliTEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,101,ISBN

From this point he begins an investigation and analysis that reads as compellingly as a good detective story. Focusing on the central books of the Old Testament--Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy--he draws upon biblical and archaeological evidence to make a convincing argument for the identities of their authors. In the process he paints a vivid picture of the world of the Bible--its politics, history, and personalities. The result is a marvel of scholarship that sheds a new and enriching light on our understanding of the Bible as literature, history, and sacred text.",Jonathan Cape,Jonathan Cape,Biblical Studies,Bible,Hardback,101774,,Lending,,101,ISBN

The Christian era is coming to an end: after two thousand years the religious faith which shaped western civilisation has been found wanting. After examining the reasons for Christianity's decline, the author writes eloquently about the likely shape of the global future. People everywhere will recognise his concerns at the turn of the century -- the fragility of the environment, the population explosion, the conflict of cultures, the deepening poverty, the ongoing nuclear threat. This is a book about endings, and about potential catastrophes. Yet Lloyd Geering also offers hope ... he sketches a future global society arising out of our increasing awareness of the current human predicament and of our dependence on the earth. The evolution of global consciousness could provide the spiritual dimension of the coming global culture, and enable the eartyh and its inhabitants to survive. The future of this ""world to come"" is in our hands.""--Back cover.",Bridget Williams Books,,Christianity,Religion,,104887,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=n1gWAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,101,ISBN

For its efforts to develop rational solutions to human problems rather than invoking supernatural intervention, humanism has been rewarded with a rich and distinguished heritage whose contributors include many of the brightest minds of intellectual history. Advocating reason, critical intelligence, free and objective inquiry, democratic institutions, and moral values based on human experience, humanism stands in steadfast opposition to the moral, political, and social oppression perpetrated by all who would have us swear unquestioned allegiance to authoritarian power, be it temporal or divine. But if humanism is to remain fresh and vibrant, alert and ever vigilant, it must continuously assess and evaluate its goals in light of new experience. In The Question of Humanism, 23 contributors investigate the meaning of humanism today, its range of perspectives, and how humanists can deal with the challenges of contemporary life and those it will face as the new century approaches. This absorbing collection of original essays examines the abundant variety of historical and contemporary humanist philosophies, with special emphasis on the work of Thomas Aquinas, Immanuel Kant, Soren Kierkegaard, Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche, Martin Heidegger, and Michel Foucault. Focusing on the need for an awareness of humanist tradition, these essays offer blunt, progressive self-appraisals to illustrate how humanism will continue to grow as a vital and compelling intellectual force. Featured are essays by Cecil Abrahams, Zygmunt Adamczewski, Samuel Ajzenstat, Martin Andic, Allan Booth, Richard Brown, Michael Cardy, Kenneth Dorter, Richard Francis, David Goicoechea, Danny Goldstick, Calvin Hayes, Marsha Hewitt, Monica Hornyansky, Paul Kurtz, James Lawler, John Luik, Robert McLaughlin, Graeme Nicholson, Zaid Orudjev, Robert Perkins, Charles Scott, and Edward A.

Flight from science specifically, among the forms of rational inquiry, goes back as far as science itself... But rejection of reason is now a pattern to be found in most branches of scholarship and in all the learned professions.""--from the introduction In the widely acclaimed Higher Superstition: The Academic Left and Its Quarrels with Science, Paul R. Gross and Norman Levitt offered a spirited response to the ""science bashers,"" raising serious questions about the growing criticism of scientific practice from humanists and social scientists on the academic left. Now, in The Flight from Science and Reason, Gross and Levitt are joined by Martin W. Lewis to bring together a diverse and distinguished group of scholars, scientists, and experts to engage these questions from a wide variety of perspectives. The authors take on critics of science whose views range from moderate to extreme, from social constructivists to deconstructionists, from creationists and feminists to Afro-centrists. They discuss the rise of ""alternative medicine"" and radical environmentalism (here skewered as ""ecosentimentalism""). They explain why the ""uncertainty principle"" does not work as a metaphor for ambiguity, and why ""chaos theory"" cannot be invoked without an understanding of mathematics. Throughout, they grapple with the paradox inherent in arguing with opponents who contend that reason itself, and thus logic, is suspect.

A fire needs only three things: a spark to ignite it, and fuel and oxygen to feed it. In 1666, a ten-month drought had turned London into a tinderbox. The older parts of the city were almost entirely composed of wood-frame buildings and shanties little more than paper shacks. The riverside wharves and warehouses were stacked with wood, coal and every combustible material known to seventeenth-century man. The fuel was already in place. A fierce easterly gale springing up at the start of September provided the oxygen. All that was now needed was a spark. On 2 September, 1666, London ignited. Over the next four days the gale blew without interruption and the resulting firestorm destroyed the whole city. The Dreadful Judgement is a historical detective story, combining modern knowledge of the physics of fire, forensics, and fire and arson investigation, with moving eye-witness accounts contained in contemporary documents, private papers and personal letters, to produce a searing depiction of the Great Fire of London and the human stories of those who lived through it and those who did not. Meticulously researched, vividly written, this astonishing true story of one of the most famous yet least understood events in history casts fresh light on the shadowy background to the Great Fire, and brings to startling life the power of one of mankind's oldest, most implacable enemies.",Doubleday,,History / London,Fire,Paperback,101487,14,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zRtAPgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,101,ISBN

In particular it challenges the current 'modernist' orthodoxies of such writers as Eric Hobsbawm, Benedict Anderson and Ernest Gellner, and it offers a systematic critique of Hobsbawm's best-selling Nations and Nationalism since 1780. In opposition to a historiography which limits nations and nationalism to the eighteenth century and after, as an aspect of 'modernisation', Professor Hastings argues for a medieval origin to both, dependent upon biblical religion and the development of vernacular literatures. While theorists of nationhood have paid mostly scant attention to England, the development of the nation-state is seen here as central to the subject, but the analysis is carried forward to embrace many other examples, including Ireland, the South Slavs and modern Africa, before concluding with an overview of the impact of religion, contrasting Islam with Christianity, while evaluating the ability of each to support supra-national political communities.",Cambridge University Press,Cambridge University Press,History,History,Paperback,104600,15,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uMJDaelOpsgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,101,ISBN

What is the nature of reality? Is the apparent 'grand design' of our universe evidence for a benevolent creator who set things in motion? Or does science offer another explanation? In The Grand Design, the most recent scientific thinking about the mysteries of the universe is presented, in language marked by both brilliance and simplicity. The Grand Design explains the latest thoughts about model-dependent realism (the idea that there is no one version of reality), and about the multiverse concept of reality in which there are many universes. There are new ideas about the top-down theory of cosmology (the idea that there is no one history of the universe, but that every possible history exists).It concludes with a riveting assessment of m-theory, and discusses whether it is the unified theory Einstein spent a lifetime searching for.This is the first major work in nearly a decade by one of the world's greatest thinkers.

The essays in this volume--intriguing, challenging, and often baffling to the reader--call him always to abandon all superficial scanning and to enter wholeheartedly into the serious pursuit of thinking.... ""Heidegger is not a 'primitive' or a 'romanitic.' He is not one who seeks escape from the burdens and responsibilities of contemporary life into serenity, either through the re-creating of some idyllic past or through the exalting of some simple experience. Finally, Heidegger is not a foe of technology and science. He neither disdains nor rejects them as though they were only destructive of human life. ""The roots of Heidegger's hinking lie deep in the Western philosophical tradition. Yet that thinking is unique in many of its aspects, in its language, and in its leterary expression. In the development of this thought Heidegger has been taught chiefly by the Greeks, by German idealism, by phenomenology, and by the scholastic theological tradition. In him these and other elements have been fused by his genius of sensitivity and intellect into a very individual philosophical expression."" --William Lovitt, from the Introduction",Harper & Row,Harper Collins,Philosophy,Philosophy,,106511,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oeV9q6kWG38C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,101,ISBN

"Against the Faith: Essays on Deists, Skeptics and Atheists",Against the Faith,Jim Herrick,Jim Herrick,1985,1985,0879752882,"UOM:39015015357158, 0879752882",250,260,,"""The subject of this book is those who have placed themselves 'against the faith', in other words, those who have opposed the prevailing religious faith of their time. Such opponents adopt this position for a wide variety of reasons and in many different ways. They are sometimes fiery activists hammering against leaders and leading ideas and at other times are quiet, contemplative skeptics questioning all knowledge and all orthodoxy. They can be immersed in the politics of their time, like Bradlaugh or Thomas Paine. They can be poets like Heine and Shelley, historians like Gibbon, playwrights like Buchner, or novelists like George Eliot and Mark Twain. They may be scientists like Huxley, or philosophers like J.S. Mill. They may be most at home on the public platform, like Ingersoll, or in the study like Pierre Bayle. They can be relaxed men of the world like Hume or temperamental outsiders like d'Holbach. They may lead quiet and little known lives like the freethinker Collins or the clergyman Meslier, or they may be outstanding polymaths of their age, like Voltaire or Bertrand Russell. This book covers deists, skeptics and atheists. Without attempting to be comprehensive, I have tried to show that there is a spectrum between the three. There has often been close contact between deists, who gently criticize the Christian faith, skeptics who questions all knowledge, and atheists, who detach themselves from any belief in God. Occasionally individuals have held all these positions at different periods of their lives. Furthermore the distinction sometimes made between the respectable philosophic skeptic and the disreputable agitating atheist is not clear-cut: philosophers sometimes agitate and frequently rub shoulders with activists, and reformers and campaigners often think quite deeply. Since this book in the main covers Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the faith opposed is Christianity. A history of opponents to Hinduism, Islam and Buddhism would provide fascinating parallels, but that book has yet to be written. It is a mistake - and one to which opponents are particularly prone - to imagine the 'faith' as a monolithic entity, rather than an accumulation of various traditions. There can therefore be opposition to the faith from within as well as without and heresy and heterodoxy have sometimes been not far apart.""",Prometheus Books,Skeptic's Bookshelf,Essays,Religion,Hardback,101544,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=abzXAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,101,ISBN

The Sunday collection in every Catholic church throughout the world is as familiar a part of the Mass as the homily and even Communion. There is no doubt that historically the Catholic Church has been one of the great engines of charity in history. But once a dollar is dropped in that basket, where does it go? How are weekly cash contributions that can amount to tens of thousands of dollars accounted for? Where does the money go when a diocese sells a church property for tens of millions of dollars? And what happens when hundreds of millions of dollars are turned over to officials at the highest ranks, no questions asked, for their discretionary use? The Roman Catholic Church is the largest organization in the world. The Vatican has never revealed its net worth, but the value of its works of art, great churches, property in Rome, and stocks held through its bank easily run into the tens of billions. Yet the Holy See as a sovereign state covers a mere 108 acres and has a small annual budget of about $280 million. No major book has examined the church’s financial underpinnings and practices with such journalistic force. Today the church bears scrutiny by virtue of the vast amounts of money (nearly $2 billion in the United States alone) paid out to victims of clergy abuse. Amid mounting diocesan bankruptcies, bishops have been selling off whole pieces of the infrastructure—churches, schools, commercial properties—while the nephew of one of the Vatican’s most powerful cardinals engaged in a lucrative scheme to profiteer off the enormous downsizing of American church wealth.",Random House New York,Crown,Islam,Religion,,103240,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Gfuu9WN4eVEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,101,ISBN

What goal--if any--is the proper end of scientific activity? Is there a legitimating authority that scientists mayclaim? Howserious athreat are the anti-science movements? These questions have long been debated but, as Gerald Holton points out, every era must offer its own responses. This book examines these questions not in the abstract but shows their historic roots and the answers emerging from the scientific and political controversies of this century. Employing the case-study method and the concept of scientific thematathat he has pioneered, Holton displays the broad scope of his insight into the workings of science: from the influence of Ernst Mach on twentiethcentury physicists, biologists, psychologists, and other thinkers to the rhetorical strategies used in the work of Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, and others; from the bickering between Thomas Jefferson and the U.S. Congress over the proper form of federal sponsorship of scientific research to philosophical debates since Oswald Spengier over whether our scientific knowledge will ever be ""complete."" In a masterful final chapter, Holton scrutinizes the ""anti-science phenomenon,"" the increasingly common opposition to science as practiced today. He approaches this contentious issue by examining the world views and political ambitions of the proponents of science as well as those of its opponents-the critics of ""establishment science"" (including even those who fear that science threatens to overwhelm the individual in the postmodern world) and the adherents of ""alternative science"" (Creationists, New Age ""healers,"" astrologers). Through it all runs the thread of the author's deep historical knowledge and his humanistic understanding of science in modern culture. Science and Anti-Science will be of great interest not only to scientists and scholars in the field of science studies but also to educators, policymalcers, and all those who wish to gain a fuller understanding of challenges to and doubts about the role of science in our lives today.",Harvard University Press,,Science / Philosophy,Science,Paperback,103241,28.95,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=U46LQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,101,ISBN

It gives clear and reliable guidance to all areas of philosophy and to the ideas of all notable philosophers from antiquity to the present day.

A distinguished international assembly of more than two hundred contributors provide almost 2,000 alphabetically arranged entries which are not only instructive but also entertaining: they combine learning, lucidity, elegance, and wit. There are more than fifty extended entries of 3,000 words on themain areas of philosophy and the great philosophers: these include essays by Alasdair MacIntyre on the history of moral philosophy, Paul Feyerabend on the history of the philosophy of science, Jaegwon Kim on problems of the philosophy of mind, Richard Swinburne on problems of the philosophy ofreligion, David Charles on Aristotle, Peter Singer on Hegel, Anthony Kenny on Frege, and Anthony Quinton on philosophy itself. Short entries deal with key concepts (for instance, personal identity, time) doctrines (utilitarianism, holism), problems (the mind-body problem, the meaning of life), schools of thought (Marxist philosophy, the Vienna Circle), and practical issues (abortion, vegetarianism). Individual thinkerspast (Pythagoras, Confucius, Galileo, Goethe, Burke, Santayana, de Beauvoir, Radhakrishnan) and present (over 150 contemporary figures, such as Chomsky, Derrida, and Popper) are profiled, and eighty of them are depicted in black-and-white portraits. Interspersed throughout are short explanations ofparticular philosophical terms (qualia, supervenience, iff), puzzles (the Achilles paradox, the prisoner's dilemma), and curiosities (the philosopher's stone, slime). Every entry is accompanied by suggestions for further reading. A chronological chart of the history of philosophy is located at theend of the book, together with fourteen diagrams showing the structure of philosophy and the relations between its subjects and doctrines.

How do we come to have knowledge of God? Who has the burden of proof with respect to these matters of intense religious significance, and what sort of proof might gain universal assent? Can one argue from the orderliness of the universe to the conclusion that it must have had a purposeful creator at its helm?

A pinnacle of English empiricism, it is a comprehensive attempt to apply scientific methods of observation to a study of human nature, and a vigorous attack upon the principles of traditional metaphysical thought. With masterly eloquence, Hume denies the immortality of the soul and the reality of space; considers the manner in which we form concepts of identity, cause and effect; and speculates upon the nature of freedom, virtue and emotion. Opposed both to metaphysics and to rationalism, Hume's philosophy of informed scepticism sees man not as a religious creation, nor as a machine, but as a creature dominated by sentiment, passion and appetite.

Jefferson was convinced that the authentic message of Jesus could be found only by extracting from the Gospels Jesus's message of absolute love and service, rather than the miracle of the Annunciation, Virgin Birth, or even the Resurrection.

Again and again, Revelation has stirred some dangerous men and women to act out their own private apocalypses. Above all, the moral calculus of Revelation—the demonization of one's enemies, the sanctification of revenge taking, and the notion that history must end in catastrophe—can be detected in some of the worst atrocities and excesses of every age, including our own. For all of these reasons, the rest of us ignore the book of Revelation only at our impoverishment and, more to the point, at our own peril."" The mysterious author of the Book of Revelation (or the Apocalypse, as the last book of the New Testament is also known) never considered that his sermon on the impending end times would last beyond his own life. In fact, he predicted that the destruction of the earth would be witnessed by his contemporaries. Yet Revelation not only outlived its creat∨ this vivid and violent revenge fantasy has played a significant role in the march of Western civilization. Ever since Revelation was first preached as the revealed word of Jesus Christ, it has haunted and inspired hearers and readers alike. The mark of the beast, the Antichrist, 666, the Whore of Babylon, Armageddon, and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are just a few of the images, phrases, and codes that have burned their way into the fabric of our culture. The questions raised go straight to the heart of the human fear of death and obsession with the afterlife. Will we, individually or collectively, ride off to glory, or will we drown in hellfire for all eternity? As those who best manipulate this dark vision learned, which side we fall on is often a matter of life or death. Honed into a weapon in the ongoing culture wars between states, religions, and citizenry, Revelation has significantly altered the course of history. Kirsch, whom the Washington Post calls ""a fine storyteller with a flair for rendering ancient tales relevant and appealing to modern audiences,"" delivers a far-ranging, entertaining, and shocking history of this scandalous book, which was nearly cut from the New Testament. From the fall of the Roman Empire to the Black Death, the Inquisition to the Protestant Reformation, the New World to the rise of the Religious Right, this chronicle of the use and abuse of the Book of Revelation tells the tale of the unfolding of history and the hopes, fears, dreams, and nightmares of all humanity.",Harper San Francisco,Harper Collins,History,History,,106186,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DEOIryG_UDYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,101,ISBN

In this original and penetrating book, America's leading secular humanist philosopher affirms that it is possible to live the good life and be morally responsible without belief in religion. Kurtz delineates the means by which humanity can transcend the limitations of traditional religious loyalties and achieve a higher stage of ethics. In order to progress to a maximum level of creative development, the author maintains that we must be nourished by the ""forbidden fruit"" of the knowledge of good and evil, grounding principles and values in autonomous reason. This is the path that leads to the discovery of significant ethical truths that can guide both self-reliant conduct and consideration for the rights of others. By breaking the bonds of theistic illusion, we can summon the courage and wisdom to develop a rational ethic based on a realistic appraisal of nature and an awareness of the centrality of the moral decencies common to all peoples. The ultimate key to the good life is to eat of the fruit of the second tree in the Garden of Eden - the tree of life - discovering for ourselves the manifold potentialities for a bountiful existence.",Prometheis Books,,Humanism,Philosophy,Hardback,101881,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=w8UlAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,101,ISBN

Even movements like ""biblical theology"" or the kind of theology of revelation centered on Jesus Christ, such as Karl Barth championed, seem to have had their day in our pluralistic world. In addition, a return to the liberalism that was so dominant at the beginning of this century - important though many of its insights and approaches may still be - seems impossible. What, then, is the alternative? The only course open is to go forward from where we are now, taking seriously all of the features of our modern world. This is what Daniel Liechty aspires to do in this book. Writing from experience in the United States and in Europe, against a Quaker and Mennonite background, he offers a fascinating outline of postliberal theology, covering all the major theological themes: evil, God, Jesus, Christology, Church, dogma and world faiths. Liechty may not be the first to make such an attempt, but his work excels due to its combination of depth and its remarkable clarity. As he comments: ""I have tried here simply to say what I have to say, as clearly as possible and as briefly as possible."" In Theology in Postliberal Perspective many will find precisely the kind of guidance to their thinking that they have been looking for in our perplexing age.",SCM Press,Burns & Oates,Theology,Philosophy,,106262,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=o6wqAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,101,ISBN

Mixing historical narrative, thought-provoking arguments, and on-the-scene reporting and interviews, Brink Lindsey shows how the economy has grown up amidst the wreckage of the old regime-detailing how that wreckage constrains the present and obscures the future.

The author, himself a former member of Greenpeace, is critical of the way in which many environmental organisations make selective and misleading use of the scientific evidence. Using the best available statistical information from internationally recognised research institutes, Bjørn Lomborg systematically examines a range of major environmental problems that feature prominently in headline news across the world. His arguments are presented in non-technical, accessible language and are carefully backed up by over 2500 footnotes allowing readers to check sources for themselves. Concluding that there are more reasons for optimism than pessimism, Bjørn Lomborg stresses the need for clear-headed prioritisation of resources to tackle real, not imagined problems. The Skeptical Environmentalist offers readers a non-partisan stocktaking exercise that serves as a useful corrective to the more alarmist accounts favoured by campaign groups and the media.",Cambridge University Press,Cambridge University Press,Environmentalism,Business & Economics,Paperback,104202,60,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JuLko8USApwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,101,ISBN

Leading economists evaluate the evidence for costs and benefits of various programs to help gauge how we can achieve the most good with our money. Each problem is introduced by a world-renowned expert analyzing the scale of the problem and describing the costs and benefits of a range of policy options to improve the situation. Shorter pieces from experts offering alternative positions are also included; all ten challenges are evaluated by a panel of economists from North America, Europe, and China who rank the most promising policy options. Global Crises, Global Solutions provides a serious, yet accessible, springboard for debate and discussion and will be required reading for government employees, NGOs, scholars and students of public policy and applied economics, and anyone with a serious professional or personal interest in global development issues.

MacDonald offers an entirely new view of the New Testament gospel of Mark. The author of the earliest gospel was not writing history, nor was he merely recording tradition, MacDonald argues. Close reading and careful analysis show that Mark borrowed extensively from the Odyssey and the Iliad and that he wanted his readers to recognise the Homeric antecedents in Mark's story of Jesus. Mark was composing a prose anti-epic, MacDonald says, presenting Jesus as a suffering hero modeled after but far superior to traditional Greek heroes. Much like Odysseus, Mark's Jesus sails the seas with uncomprehending companions, encounters preternatural opponents, and suffers many things before confronting rivals who have made his house a den of thieves. In his death and burial, Jesus emulates Hector, although unlike Hector Jesus leaves his tomb empty. Mark's minor characters, too, recall Homeric predecessors: Bartimaeus emulates Tiresias; Joseph of Arimathea, Priam; and the women at the tomb, Helen, Hecuba, and Andromache.

Carefully examining the current debate in Anglo-American analytic philosophy regarding God's existence, Martin presents a comprehensive critique of the arguments for the existence of God and a defense of arguments against the existence of God, showing in detail their relevance to atheism. Claiming that atheism is a rational position while theistic beliefs are not, he relies both on logic and evidence and confines his efforts to showing the irrationality of belief in a personal supreme being who is omniscient, omnipotent, perfect, and the creator of heaven and earth. The author's approach is two-fold. By presenting and criticizing arguments that have been advanced in favor of belief, he makes a case for ""negative atheism."" By offering arguments against atheism and defending it from these attacks, he presents a case for ""positive atheism."" Along the way, he confronts the views of numerous philosophers—among them Anselm, Aquinas, Plantinga, Hick, and Swinburne—and refutes both classical and contemporary arguments that have been advanced through the history of this debate. In his conclusion, Martin considers what would and would not follow if his main arguments were widely accepted, and he defines and distinguishes atheism from other ""isms"" and movements. Building on the work of religious skeptics and atheists of the past and present, he justifies his reconstruction of this philosophical dispute by citing some of the most interesting and important arguments for atheism and criticisms of arguments for the existence of God that have appeared in recent journal articles and have yet to be systematically addressed.

Not since Darwin's The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals has a book so thoroughly and effectively explored the full range of emotions that exist throughout the animal kingdom. From dancing squirrels to bashful gorillas to spiteful killer whales, Masson and coauthor Susan McCarthy bring forth fascinating anecdotes and illuminating insights that offer powerful proof of the existence of animal emotion. Chapters on love, joy, anger, fear, shame, compassion, and loneliness are framed by a provocative re-evaluation of how we treat animals, from hunting and eating them to scientific experimentation.

He regards it as self-evident that the therapist makes demands on the patient that cannot be fulfilled and that the financial exigencies of the relationship are open to corruption. Masson sets out to show that ""abuse of one form or another is built into the very fabric of psychotherapy"", that ""it is the nature of therapy to distort another person's reality"" and that since it is the therapist's task to change people, and that this can only be done according to the therapists' own notions and prejudices, the psychological process is necessarily corrupt. The author delves into the practices of many well-known therapists. Beginning with cases from the 19th century when patients could be incarcerated while patently sane, he goes on to attack Jung as well as practitioners like Fritz Perls and Carl Rogers, attempting to demonstrate that whether the approach is confrontational or sympathetic, a benign despotism is not better than a malign one. Masson has also written ""The Assault on Truth: Freud's Suppression of the Seduction Theory"", ""The Oceanic Feeling: The Origins of Religious Sentiment in Ancient India"", ""A Dark Science: Women, Sexuality and Psychiatry in the Nineteenth Century"" and ""The Complete Letters of Sigmund Freud to Wilhelm Fliess, 1887-1904"".",Common Courage Press,,Psychotherapy,Medical,Paperback,102437,32,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lIkoAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,101,ISBN

The structure of the book never changed, but its breadth caused him to complete it in stages, under the overall title Annals of the Former World. Like the terrain it covers, Annals of the Former World tells a multilayered tale, and the reader may choose one of many paths through it. As clearly and succinctly written as it is profoundly informed, this is our finest popular survey of geology and a masterpiece of modern nonfiction.

It is one of the great wellsprings of Western religious, ethical, and philosophical traditions. It has been an endless source of inspiration to artists, from classic works such as Michaelangelo's Last Judgment, Handel's Messiah, or Milton's Paradise Lost, to modern works such as Thomas Mann's Joseph and His Brothers or Martin Scorsese's controversial Last Temptation of Christ. For countless generations, it has been a comfort in suffering, a place to reflect on the mysteries of birth, death, and immortality. Its stories and characters are an integral part of the repertoire of every educated adult, forming an enduring bond that spans thousands of years and embraces a vast community of believers and nonbelievers. The Oxford Companion to the Bible provides an authoritative one-volume reference to the people, places, events, books, institutions, religious belief, and secular influence of the Bible. Written by more than 250 scholars from some 20 nations and embracing a wide variety of perspectives, the Companion offers over seven hundred entries, ranging from brief identifications--who is Dives? where is Pisgah?--to extensive interpretive essays on topics such as the influence of the Bible on music or law. Ranging far beyond the scope of a traditional Bible dictionary, the Companion features, in addition to its many informative, factual entries, an abundance of interpretive essays. Here are extended entries on religious concepts from immortality, sin, and grace, to baptism, ethics, and the Holy Spirit. The contributors also explore biblical views of modern issues such as homosexuality, marriage, and anti-Semitism, and the impact of the Bible on the secular world (including a four-part article on the Bible's influence on literature). Of course, the Companion can also serve as a handy reference, the first place to turn to find factual information on the Bible. Readers will find fascinating, informative articles on all the books of the Bible--including the Apocrypha and many other ancient texts, such as the Dead Sea Scrolls, Pseudepigrapha, and the Mishrah. Virtually every figure who walked across the biblical stage is identified here, ranging from Rebekah, Rachel, and Mary, to Joseph, Barabbas, and Jesus. The Companion also offers entries that shed light on daily life in ancient Israel and the earliest Christian communities, with fascinating articles on feasts and festivals, clothing, medicine, units of time, houses, and furniture. Finally, there are twenty-eight pages of full-color maps, providing an accurate, detailed portrait of the biblical world.

He reveals the extent to which Greek, Persian, and Jewish historians influenced the Western historiographic tradition, and then goes on to examine the first Roman historians and the emergence of national history. In the course of his exposition, he traces the development of antiquarian studies as distinctive branch of historical research from antiquity to the modern period, discusses the place of Tacitus in historical thought, and explores the way in which ecclesiastical historiography has developed a tradition of its own. All these lectures illustrate Momigliano's unrivaled ability to combine the study of classical texts and the history of classical scholarship. First delivered in 1962, the lectures were revised during the next fifteen years and then held for annotation that was never completed. They are now published from the author's manuscripts, collated and checked by Momigliano's literary executor, Anne Marie Meyer, of the Warburg Institute, with a foreword by Riccardo Di Donato, of the University of Pisa.

And how did the vast variety of species we see around us, and those long-extinct, come to be? One of the intellectual wonders of our time has been biologists' gradual untangling of these great mysteries, beginning with the investigations of Aristotle and the Greeks, continuing through the experiments and theories of Darwin and his contemporaries, and culminating in the researches of geneticists, developmental biologists, paleontologists, and other specialists in the twentieth century.",Harvard University Press,,Science / Biology,Science,Hardback,102334,,Lending,,101,ISBN

SPIRIT IN A STRANGE LAND is the first-ever collection of poetry that focuses on a rich vein in New Zealand writing: our spiritual experience. Religious poetry has always been evident in anthologies, but by expanding the notion of religion beyond a narrow doctrinal frame and the portals of the Church, a surprising abundance of treasures is revealed. This collection is religiously, spiritually, historically and culturally diverse, reflecting the multiplicity of our spiritualities. Poems are arranged under seven headings designed to reflect these diversities: Godzone; Holidays and Holy Days; Saints and Sinners; Troubled Souls; Jesus Alone; Book of the Land; Rebels and Recluses. Included are works from internationally recognised local poets who have made their contribution to modern religious verse, eg Allen Curnow, James K Baxter, as well as others whose work is not conventionally or intentionally religious, eg Lauris Edmond, Jenny Bornholdt and Andrew Johnson. This book is a perfect resource for any occasion with a spiritual dimension-religious services, weddings, funerals, celebrations of may kinds. It will also find a place in schools and universities, and provide inspiration and insight for New Zealanders with an interest in spirituality and poetry.",Godwint,,Religious Verse,New Zealand poetry,Paperback,104554,,Lending,,101,ISBN

It was here that he first proclaimed the death of God—to which a large part of the book is devoted—and his doctrine of the eternal recurrence. Walter Kaufmann's commentary, with its many quotations from previously untranslated letters, brings to life Nietzsche as a human being and illuminates his philosophy. The book contains some of Nietzsche's most sustained discussions of art and morality, knowledge and truth, the intellectual conscience and the origin of logic. Most of the book was written just before Thus Spoke Zarathustra, the last part five years later, after Beyond Good and Evil. We encounter Zarathustra in these pages as well as many of Nietzsche's most interesting philosophical ideas and the largest collection of his own poetry that he himself ever published. Walter Kaufmann's English versions of Nietzsche represent one of the major translation enterprises of our time. He is the first philosopher to have translated Nietzsche's major works, and never before has a single translator given us so much of Nietzsche.",Vintage Books,Vintage,Philosophy,Philosophy,,106073,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4R_v6HgIjxUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,101,ISBN

Twilight of the Idols is a ‘grand declaration of war’ on reason, psychology and theology that combines highly charged personal attacks on his contemporaries with a lightning tour of his own philosophy. It also paves the way for The Anti-Christ, Nietzche’s final assault on institutional Christianity, in which he identifies himself with the ‘Dionysian’ artist and confronts Christ; the only opponent he feels worthy of him.

Even more remarkable than Numbers's story of today's widespread rejection of the theory of evolution is the dramatic shift from acceptance of the earth's antiquity to the insistence of present-day scientific creationists that most fossils date back to Noah's flood and its aftermath, and that the earth itself is not more than ten thousand years old.

He argues that much of our social commentary, conventional wisdom, and academic orthodoxy is wrongly rooted in the doctrines of the noble savage (civilisation is the source of human corruption) and the blank slate (the mind has no innate structure; all thoughts and feelings seep into our heads from surrounding culture). He explores the impact of these notions on our attitudes to sexuality, ideology, political correctness and the arts, and insists that we need to be more honest about human nature.",Allen Lane / Penguin,Allan Lane,Evolutionary Psychology,Psychology,Paperback,104538,39.95,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5PVOAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,101,ISBN

From their conversation emerges a series of subtle reflections on gender roles, sex in society and the sublimation of basic human instincts. The discussion culminates in a radical challenge to conventional views by Plato's mentor, Socrates, who advocates transcendence through spiritual love. The Symposium is a deft interweaving of different viewpoints and ideas about the nature of love—as a response to beauty, a cosmic force, a motive for social action and as a means of ethical education.

Mingling acute observation with often wild speculation, it offers a fascinating view of the world as it was understood in the first century AD, whether describing the danger of diving for sponges, the first water-clock, or the use of asses’ milk to remove wrinkles. Pliny himself died while investigating the volcanic eruption that destroyed Pompeii in AD 79, and the natural curiosity that brought about his death is also very much evident in the Natural History — a book that proved highly influential right up until the Renaissance and that his nephew, Pliny the younger, described ‘as full of variety as nature itself’. John F. Healy has made a fascinating and varied selection from the Natural History for this clear, modern translation. In his introduction, he discusses the book and its sources topic by topic.

Whilst philosophy of physics pushed confidently ahead, the philosophy of biology languished. In the past decade, however, things have changed dramatically. A number of energetic and thoughtful young philosophers have made real efforts to master the outlines and details of contemporary biology. They have shown that many stimulating problems emerge when analytic skills are turned towards the life-sciences, particularly if one does not feeI con strained to stay only with theoretical parts of biology, but can range over to more medical parts of the spectrum.

Now in this stunning sequel, Carl Sagan completes his revolutionary journey through space and time.

The exploration and eventual settlement of other worlds is neither a fantasy nor luxury, insists Sagan, but rather a necessary condition for the survival of the human race.

The Reformation's over-valuation of scripture exposed that book to strains beyond its tolerance and as the European world expanded and developed in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the Bible steadily lost its central role as the sun of the human solar system. The heart of this book is the Scholder's analysis of Socinian theology which was able to use the Bible to subvert the orthodox Trinitarian thought, and the collapse of the credibility of the biblical picture of the world under the influence of Copernicus and the rapid expansion of knowledge about the physical world and human history.' - Book review in the Scottish Journal of Theology , Volume 47 , Issue 3 , August 1994 , pp. 394 - 395.",SCM Press,Trinity Press International,Theology,Religion,,106157,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=U8DYAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,101,ISBN

However, by 1896 Zola came to oppose the antisemitic movement and its fanatic xenophobia and advocated assimilation of the Jews. Deals, also, with his involvement in the Dreyfus Affair, his articles in ""Le Figaro"" in 1897 and his famous letter ""J'accuse"", exposing the conspiracy by the Army and the War Office, which led to violent antisemitic demonstrations against him. Condemned for defamation, Zola fled to England and returned when Dreyfus was retried.

For several years of his turbulent life, Seneca was the guiding hand of the Roman Empire. His inspired reasoning derived mainly from the Stoic principles, which had originally been developed some centuries earlier in Athens. This selection of Seneca's letters shows him upholding the austere ethical ideals of Stoicism—the wisdom of the self-possessed person immune to overmastering emotions and life’s setbacks—while valuing friendship and the courage of ordinary men, and criticizing the harsh treatment of slaves and the cruelties in the gladiatorial arena. The humanity and wit revealed in Seneca’s interpretation of Stoicism is a moving and inspiring declaration of the dignity of the individual mind.

Organized around the main schools of thought, and ranging from ancient Greece through the explosion of ideas in the 17th century to the Enlightenment and the challenge of 20th-century philosophy, each chapter assesses the contribution of a philosopher with particular attention paid to the key areas of the theory of knowledge, the nature of reality and the nature of philosophy itself.

The accessible essays and attractive illustrations portray the emergence and development of the distinctive civilization of the ancient Egyptians, from theirprehistoric origins to their incorporation into the Roman Empire, covering the period from c. 700,000 BC AD 311. The authors each experts working at the cutting edge of their particular fields outline the principal sequence of political events, including detailed examinations of the threeso-called 'intermediate periods' which were previously regarded as 'dark ages' and are only now beginning to be better understood. Against the backdrop of the rise and fall of ruling dynasties, this Oxford Illustrated History also examines cultural and social patterns, including stylistic developments in art and literature. The pace of change in such aspects of Egyptian culture as monumental architecture, funerary beliefs, andethnicity was not necessarily tied to the rate of political change.

In his explosive, controversial book, Sheaffer predicts that a society which truly believes that failure is blessed will not long prevail on this earth. Excoriating ""negative entropy"" as a virtue, Sheaffer describes two fundamentally differing systems of morality which, he writes, have created a pervasive, complex conflict throughout the history of mankind. The first he describes as the pride of achievement; the second as the resentment felt against those who achieve by those who do not. These two foundations of morality are totally incompatible and antithetical, yet appear in varying degrees in all societies. When the morality of achievement predominates, Sheaffer writes, civilizations flourish in commerce, the arts, and science; societies leave a heritage of progress and achievement to future generations. When the morality of resentment gains the upper hand, civilizations decline and eventually perish. Sheaffer describes a civilization as the sum total of all the achievements of its people and, as achievement becomes increasingly discouraged, scorned, and even persecuted, the forward momentum of a society is halted and ultimately reversed. Only in decadent, declining societies, Sheaffer claims, is the whining of the inept mistaken for a lofty moral statement. Sheaffer recommends that achievers set a goal: helping those filled with resentment learn to achieve. The key element, he writes, is to prevent resentment from becoming a profitable strategy. Achievers must stop seeking to purchase the favorable opinion of those who vilify achievement and force the resentful to fall back on their own capacity to achieve - however meager that may be. The numbers of the resentful will continue to increase as long as the government subsidizes resentment by supporting any and all who refuse to accept the discipline of work. His final words to those who ascribe to the highest standards of civilization are ""Fight Back."" The future depends on whether resentment or achievement prevails as the dominant moral vision.",Prometheus Books,,Success / Resentment,Philosophy,Hardback,103657,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4O5GAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,101,ISBN

What has led to the rise of ""scientific creationism"" and the belief that the Holocaust never happened? Why, in this age of supposed scientific knowledge, do many people seem to be so strangely confused? In this book, science historian Michael Shermer explores the reasons why we find otherworldly phenomena, conspiracy theories, and cults to appealing. Shermer shows how the eternal search for meaning and spiritual fulfillment often leaves us susceptible to extraordinary claims and unsubstantiated ideas, particularly in the realms of superstition and the supernatural. But Shermer also reveals the darker and more fearful side of wishful thinking, including Holocaust denial, the satanic ritual abuse scare, and ideologies of racial superiority. Shermer investigates these movements and the people behind them, assessing their reasoning, the factual bases for their claims, and their conclusions -- which are very weird indeed. You'll learn the ""magical"" techniques a famous psychic used to fool his audiences. You'll see the true views of the leaders of the Holocaust denial movement on Nazism, race, and freedom speech.

Ingersoll (1833-1899) was a complex figure - a brilliant lawyer and orator who courageously advanced the concept of freethought; a magnetic extrovert whose public esteem, eagerly sought, never earned him the private favors he so generously bestowed on others. Ingersoll was a staunch republican in the great tradition of Abraham Lincoln, and he vigorously championed such progressive causes as equal rights for blacks, women, and children; liberal divorce laws; and better wages and conditions for workers. Perhaps Ingersoll's greatest legacy derives from his daring rejection of religious superstition (during an era which saw a tremendous revival of spiritualism and religious fundamentalism) and his ardent belief in humanity: ""When I became convinced that the Universe is natural - that all the ghosts and gods are myths, there entered into my brain, into my soul, into every drop of my blood, the sense, the feeling, the joy of freedom. The walls of my prison crumbled and fell, the dungeon was flooded with light and all the bolts and bars, and manacles became dust. I was no longer a servant, a serf, or a slave."" Ingersoll is considered one of the most prominent figures of the 19th century. From about 1880 to his death in 1899, he probably spoke to more Americans in person than anyone before or since; he had daily audiences of as many as three thousand people while he was on tour, several months a year for many years. Despite this, Ingersoll's career has not yet received the attention it clearly merits. In this comprehensive work, Frank Smith explores the life and thought of this charismatic figure, using newspaper accounts of the time and extensive quotations from Ingersoll's correspondence. Ingersoll's words provide a vivid portrait of 19th-century America from the stormy antebellum period to the beginnings of modern industrialism. His life reflects the great current of his age and speaks forcefully to the problems of our own.",Prometheus Books,,"Ingersoll, Robert 1833-1899",Biography & Autobiography,Hardback,102892,69.95,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GwCxAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,101,ISBN

It recounts Philip Holden's adventures as a deer culler and contains a wealth of knowledge and hunting lore ready now to be taken up by a new generation of hunting and outdoor enthusiasts. Some of the people named in the book have moved on and the dates are old, but some things never change. The hills today are just as they were when Philip first explored them and the adventure and thrill of the hunt still resonates from the page.

In Eternal Life: A New Vision, a remarkable spiritual journey about his lifelong struggle with the questions of God and death, he reveals how he came to a new conviction about eternal life. God, says spong, is ultimately one, and each of us is part of that oneness. We do not live on after death as children who have been rewarded with heaven or punished with hell but as part of the life and being of God, sharing in God’s eternity, which is beyond the barriers of time and space. spong argues that the discovery of the eternal can be found within each of us if we go deeply into ourselves, transcend our limits and become fully human. By seeking God within, by living each day to its fullest, we will come to understand how we live eternally. Always compelling and controversial, spong, the leading Christian liberal and pioneer for human rights, wrestles with the question that all of us will ultimately face. In his final book, spong takes us beyond religion and even beyond Christianity until he arrives at the affirmation that the fully realized human life empties into and participates in the eternity of God. The pathway into God turns out to be both a pathway into ourselves and a doorway into eternal life.

He first strips back the myths that have surrounded Jesus for centuries from the virgin birth to his resurrection from the dead. Next, Spong explains how these myths arose because Jesus's followers saw everything he did through the lens of the Hebrew scriptures. With these new revelations, we are then able to see the true Jesus: a heroic figure who revealed divinity through his humanness and can still guide us today.

The issues that theology addresses, the meaning of life, the existence of God, the truth of the Bible, the possibility of life after death, are so important to people that they ought to examine both sides of these fundamental questions. The atheist and rationalist writings collected here are virtually impossible to obtain anywhere else, even in large university library collections. This material chronicles the contributions of many distinguished thinkers who have carefully investigated key issues in religion and philosophy, but have arrived at remarkably different conclusions from those of the clergy or media. We should not neglect this long and rich history or ignore the insights rooted in the freethough tradition. ""An Anthology of Atheism and Rationalism"", a thorough introduction to the writings of the world's most famous freethinkers, will lead intellectually curious and intelligent people of all religious persuasions to an increased appreciation of the scope and limitations of their own opinions and attitudes on these important issues, including the existence of God, the definition of atheism and rationalism, the possibility of Divine Revelation, the existence of the Devil, and the real history/contribution of atheism to intellectual thought.",Prometheus Books,Skeptic's Bookshelf,Atheism,Religion,Paperback,103748,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hbmsJwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,101,ISBN

Freethinkers, atheists, agnostics, skeptics, and rationalists will rejoice to discover that Dr. Gordon Stein has returned to the rich history of freethought to compile an impressive collection of powerful and thought-provoking atheist and rationalist literature. A superb complement to his first book, An Anthology of Atheism and Rationalism, A Second Anthology of Atheism and Rationalism features twenty essays and twenty-nine samples of atheist and rationalist verse by such masters as G.J. Holyoake, Robert Browning, John Keats, Annie Besant, Rudyard Kipling, Thomas Hardy, and Charles Bradlaugh, to name but a few. Many of the essays and poems in this exceptional anthology have been out of print or nearly impossible to procure for over 100 years.

Not By Design: The Origin of the Universe,Not by Design,Victor J Stenger,Victor J. Stenger,1988,1988,0879754516,"0879754516, 9780879754518",202,0,,"Much of the world seems chaotic and unpredictable, but the regular movement of celestial bodies and certain demonstrable physical phenomena seem to indicate the existence of a world that is basically orderly. This orderliness is often taken as evidence for an intelligence beyond our experience - a creator responsible for the first moment in time and all ensuing infinite patterns of the universe. Yet the science of the origin of the universe is still highly speculative and incomplete. How did the universe begin? According to Professor Victor J. Stenger, the simplest hypothesis so far is that it began by accident.Stenger insists that the existence of order does not necessarily imply that it is the result of design. Nothing currently known about the universe, he writes, requires that its structure was somehow imposed upon it from the outside. The universe is complex, but the laws of nature are simple; in fact, the universe may have originated because of a series of spontaneous random events.The book begins with a discussion of the meaning of order and examples of orderly patterns generated by chance. (Play enough poker hands, Stenger writes, and one day you will be dealt four aces.) Subsequent chapters introduce readers to the unique perspective of the universe provided by physics, with historical and philosophical material intertwined with a systematic but nontechnical presentation of basic physics. This leads to a description of the basic structure of the universe and the way in which symmetries of space, time, and inner dimensions account for the laws obeyed by particles.The origin of the universe is then described as a chance event, with space, time, matter, and the laws of nature the result of a spontaneous process of symmetry-breaking. Focusing on the question of planned versus unplanned origin, Stenger shows that the issue is not philosophical but scientific and that order can and does happen every day - by chance.Victor Stenger (Lafayette, CO) is emeritus professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Hawaii and adjunct professor of philosophy at the University of Colorado.

The fruits of his wanderings were The Histories, in which he used his narrative gifts not only to chronicle the rise of the Achaemenid Persian Empire and its war with the Greek city-states, but also to recount his experiences with the varied peoples and cultures he had encountered during his journey. Herodotus earned the nickname 'the father of history' for this, the first authentic work of historical writing in the Western literary canon. In it he explored such universal themes as the nature of freedom, the role of religion, the human costs of war, and the dangers of absolute power. But in addition to his narrative of the Greek-Persian conflict, he included in The Histories rich seams of anthropology, ethnography, geology, and geography, pioneering these fields of study. Successful navigation of this sprawling, monumental work requires an understanding of ancient geography and events that will often be unfamiliar to the modern reader. Ten years in the making, Robert Strassler's magisterial new edition of The Histories is amplified by a veritable battery of editorial features - illustrations, maps, annotations, explanatory synopses, and state-of-the-art appendices on such critical themes as Athenian government, Egypt, Persian weaponry and tactics, oracles, religion tyranny and the position of women - that makes Herodotus' masterpiece more comprehensible, more accessible, even more enjoyable than ever before. The Landmark Herodotus is the definitive edition of a Western cultural milestone.

The decision comforted his fellow clergymen who were answering his attacks on clerical privilege and literal exegesis by vengeful polemic. In the Discourses on the Miracles of our Saviour (1727-1729) and other works, he insists on a figurative exegesis and professes a spiritual Christianity which he attributes to the Church Fathers and the early Christians. His criticism implies a commitment to the verification of all alleged facts by the same criteria regardless of the theological consequences. His doctrine had raised a scandal at Cambridge where the Sidney fellow preached sermons and published a treatise in defence of it. A depression over the hostile reaction to these works may have been a pretext for allegations of madness and his temporary confinement.

Extract From Captain Stromfield's Visit to Heaven,Extract from Captain Stormfield's Visit to Heaven,Mark Twain,Mark Twain,2002,2002,1591020247,"UOM:39015056256384, 1591020247",NaN,164,,"Twain's witty vision of what heaven ""is really like"" is told from the point of view of the recently deceased Captain Stormfield. In a folksy narration peppered with sailor's jargon, the amiable, altogether down-to-earth merchant marine describes a series of amusingly disconcerting revelations about the next world. Sitting on a cloud strumming a harp all day turns out to be insufferably boring; being eternally youthful also has its drawbacks when the captain finds himself not mixing well with a crowd of insipid teenagers; and Native Americans so outnumber whites in the North American district of Paradise that the average white Anglo-Saxon male has trouble finding someone to talk to. In fact the outlandish dimensions and characteristics of heaven utterly explode every human conception. This funny, satirical spoof on human pretensions about the importance of our species in the grand scheme of things was the last published work by Mark Twain. The main character and plot were inspired by the dream of an actual sea captain whom Twain had known. Published at the beginning of the 20th century, when astronomy had just begun to reveal the huge expanse of outer space and traditional religious concepts of our place in the universe had become inadequate, Twain's humorous vision of the afterlife seems to reflect the new scientific awareness of the awesome cosmos that confronts us and the feelings of insignificance that this discovery produced. Two years after publication of this ""extract,"" originally planned as a six-chapter book, Twain himself shipped off to follow in Captain Stormfield's wake.",Prometheus Books,,Fiction,Fiction,,103825,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6nVaAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,101,ISBN

Watson also assesses the legal implications of his actions and teachings. Watson's conclusions are insightfully contrary to assumptions and sentiments that Jesus' detractors were predisposed to view him unkindly and thus somehow deserved his stinging criticisms. Jesus engendered such harsh responses from his fellow Jews, say Watson, by his apparently contemptuous or insensitive behavior that stemmed from a lack of knowledge or concern about legal and rabbinic strictures. Watson draws heavily on Mark as both the most historically plausible of the Gospels and the gospel in which the best evidence of the earliest relevant legal traditions can be found. From his earliest legal transgressions - flouting the rules of hand washing and healing by word and hand on the Sabbath - Jesus, says Watson, showed a continual escalation of hostility to Jewish law. Later presenting himself as beyond the law, Jesus directly confronted the scribes, verbally abused the Pharisees, denied part of the validity of Mosaic law, and violently disrupted Passover observances in the so-called cleansing of the Temple. As his antagonism increased, Jesus used, willfully or otherwise, weak legal arguments and misunderstood the role of the Pharisees as lawmakers. Those wary of Jesus, especially the Pharisees, at first watched him closely, even hopefully, but grew increasingly hostile toward him with each breach of law or custom. The central cause of this hostility, says Watson, was their perception of Jesus' confusion about or ignorance of the law.",University of Georgia Press,,Jesus / Law,Religion,Hardback,103892,55.5,Lending,,101,ISBN

Yet historians still cannot explain how it all really began. What made Jesus's followers claim to have seen him alive again, three days after his crucifixion? Why did Christianity take off so quickly? It is one of the biggest and most profound of all historical mysteries. This extraordinary book, based on seven years of secret research by a brilliant historian, finally provides the answer. And it lies an enigmatic relic long assumed to be a fake: the Shroud of Turin. With historical detective work and cutting-edge scientific research, art historian Thomas de Wesselow has discovered that Jesus's followers did see something at the tomb. They saw something real but out of the ordinary - something that seemed like a miracle. It was the burial cloth of Jesus, stained with his body image. This ancient marvel was hailed as a sign of the Resurrection, and kick-started the Christian faith. The Sign details conclusive evidence that the Shroud of Turin is authentic, showing that the faint image on the cloth was formed naturally through a rare chemical reaction. It then explains how this revelation solves multiple puzzles of religious history: for example, the Gospel reports of the appearances of the Risen Christ are clearly based on early viewings of the Shroud. As well as a major historical breakthrough, The Sign is a truly thrilling read - and one you will never forget.",Penguin,Penguin Books,History / Christianity,Holy Shroud,,104469,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=C2SiuAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,101,ISBN

An intellectual call to arms, Francis Wheen's Sunday Times bestseller is one of 2004's most talked about books. In 1979 two events occurred that would shape the next twenty-five years. In Britain, an era of weary consensualist politics was displaced by the arrival of Margaret Thatcher, whose ambition was to reassert 'Victorian values'. In Iran, the fundamentalist cleric Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini set out to restore a regime that had last existed almost 1,300 years ago. Between them they succeeded in bringing the twentieth century to a premature close. By 1989, Francis Fukuyama was declaring that we had now reached the End of History. What colonised the space recently vacated by notions of history, progress and reason? Cults, quackery, gurus, irrational panics, moral confusion and an epidemic of mumbo-jumbo. Modernity was challenged by a gruesome alliance of pre-modernists and post-modernists, medieval theocrats and New Age mystics. It was as if the Enlightenment had never happened. Francis Wheen, winner of the George Orwell prize, evokes the key personalities of the post-political era - including Princess Diana and Deepak Chopra, Osama Bin-Laden and Nancy Reagan's astrologer - while charting the extraordinary rise in superstition, relativism and emotional hysteria over the past quarter of a century.

Written in short, carefully numbered paragraphs of extreme compression and brilliance, it immediately convinced many of its readers and captivated the imagination of all. Its chief influence, at first, was on the Logical Positivists of the 1920s and 30s, but many other philosophers were stimulated by its philosophy of language, finding attractive, if ultimately unsatisfactory, its view that propositions were pictures of reality. Perhaps most of all, Wittgenstein himself, after his return to philosophy in the late 1920s, was fascinated by its vision of an inexpressible, crystalline world of logical relationships. The posthumous publication of other writings has, therefore, only served to reawaken interest in the Tractatus and to illuminate its more neglected aspects. David Pears and Brian McGuinness revised their translation in the light of Wittgenstein's own suggestions and comments in his correspondence with C.K. Ogden about the first translation. In addition, this edition contains the introduction by Bertrand Russell which appeared in the original English translation.",Routledge,Psychology Press,Philosophy,Analysis (Philosophy),,104835,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pPCISQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,101,ISBN

Tracing the rise of democracy through history, Zakaria reveals why, although democracy has broken down hierarchies, opened up closed systems, and given rise to freedom in some places, it has also fostered chaos, ethnic warfare, and destroyed the very liberties and freedoms it is meant to produce. In The Future of Freedom, Zakaria calls for a re-evaluation of our beliefs in democratic ideals and, in particular, the widely held notion that more democracy means more freedom and a guarantee of greater civil and economic liberties. This book is a call for self-control, for a restoration of the balance between democracy and liberty, Zakaria writes. It is not an argument against democracy. But it is a claim that there can be such a thing as too much democracy; too much of an emphatically good thing.",W.W. Norton & Company,W. W.

When he first meets the wealthy and mercurial Maurice Levasseur, who never seems to have suffered, his hatred is immediate. But after they are thrown together during the disastrous Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71, the pair are compelled to understand one other. Forging a profound friendship, they must struggle together to endure a disorganised and brutal war, the savage destruction of France's Second Empire and the fall of Napoleon III. One of the greatest of all war novels, The Debacle is the nineteenth novel in Zola's great Rougon-Macquart cycle. A forceful and deeply moving tale of close friendship, it is also a fascinating chronicle of the events that were to lead, in the words of Zola himself, to 'the murder of a nation'.",Penguin Books,ePenguin,Franco-Prussian War,Fiction,Paperback,104139,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WuH-zAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,101,ISBN

Based on his own trip to the fabled grotto, the novel follows a simple five-part structure corresponding to the five-day train trip from Paris to Lourdes and back. Zola's brilliant observational powers are at their best as he moves from character to character describing in great detail the physical effects of their illnesses, their hopes, beliefs, fears, and above all endurance. The great novelist himself makes a brief appearance in the story, disguised as a skeptical reporter whose probing questions embarrass a doctor in charge of verifying the alleged miracles. In the end, amidst the tumult of emotions whipped up by religious fervor a miracle of a sort does take place, a psychosomatic cure of a woman suffering from hysterical paralysis. To a few skeptical observers in the entourage the event is a predictable natural occurrence, but to the majority of simple believers it is proof of divine intervention.

John Allegro bases his account on traditional texts — books of the Old Testament, Josephus, Philo Judaeus, Dio Cassius, and others — and sets out the complicated parade of plots, counter-plots, betrayals, and insurrections in a brisk and highly readable sequence. His main theme is how the conception of the Jewish nation as a divinely chosen race was planted as a political ambition among the exiled Jews. Bringing together old customs and stories, the idea was fired by the longing of the Babylonian Jews for their traditional homeland. Many of them grew prosperous outside Palestine, and their wealthy communities manipulated the wish for identity in the idea of an exclusive Judaism embodied as a political state and fighting for autonomy against local and imperial neighbors — more dream than fact. The author writes that “When the ‘new Judaism' came to be hammered out after the return from captivity, it was around these ancient customs and a historicized mythology that it was fashioned.” The religion was devised not, as popularly presented, by gift of the desert god Yahweh who had manifested himself in opposition to the Canaanite fertility god Baal but by reinterpreting the Sumerian idea of a life-giving god over many generations. For there was no fundamental opposition — the god-names originally meant the same. This second edition features a new introduction by James M.

The Six Ways of Atheism,The Six Ways of Atheism,Geoffrey Berg,Geoffrey Berg,2009,2009,,"0954395662, 9780954395667",,180,New logical disproofs of the existence God,"Geoffrey Berg, a graduate of Cambridge University, England, believes the case for atheism has never been put in as forceful and logically cogent a way as it merits, least of all by the great philosophers. In this book he sets out to remedy that by strengthening some traditional atheistic arguments and by initiating some new logical arguments for atheism. Geoffrey Berg develops six simple completely logical arguments in clear language that practically everybody can understand in a way that has never been done before to prove that belief in God is not merely unsupported by Logic but is actually contrary to Logic. This is a groundbreaking book because it is probably the first attempt by a single author that devotes an entire book to absolutely disproving the existence of God, all the time matching verbal arguments with strictly logical formulations of the argument. It aims to crystallize the case for atheism in a way that has not been done before. It is likely in retrospect to be seen as a landmark book because some of the novel arguments in this book are likely to be used hereafter by people around the world.",,G.

In his trademark journalist style, author William Bolitho details the lives of twelve great adventurers—Alexander the Great, Casanova, Christopher Columbus, Mahomet, Lola Montez, Cagliostro (and Seraphina), Charles XII of Sweden, Napoleon I, Lucius Sergius Catiline, Napoleon III, Isadora Duncan, and Woodrow Wilson. Bolitho elucidates both the struggles and successes that made these figures so iconic, and demonstrates how they all battled convention and conformity to achieve enduring fame and notoriety. “We are born adventurers,” Bolitho writes, “and the love of adventures never leaves us till we are very old; old, timid men, in whose interest it is that adventure should quite die out. This is why all the poets are on one side, and all the laws on the other; for laws are made by, and usually for, old men.” Though his essays are nearly one hundred years old, they encompass the timeless values of perseverance, bravery, and strength of spirit that have proven to resonate with the pioneers and thought leaders of today. “It’s really quite good.” —Elon Musk “Twelve Against the Gods provides an interesting perspective on what drove and impeded this group of adventurers . . . A good read for anyone who’s interested in history or looking to find some motivation to switch things up and break the rules.” —Áine Cain, Business Insider “I think Twelve Against the Gods is also very appropriate for this day and age.

All editions are complete and unabridged, and feature Introductions and Afterwords. This edition of Wuthering Heights includes a Biographical Note and Foreward by Teresa Nielsen Hayden. The dark, wild gypsy orphan Heathcliff loved only one person on earth, beautiful, willful Cathy Earnshaw. But Cathy's brother Hindley--the cruel, drunken master of Wuthering Heights--hated and abused the orphan; their rich neighbors at Thrushcross Grange, Edgar Linton and Isabella Linton, reviled the boy. They all conspired to force Heathcliff and Cathy apart, first as playmates, then as lovers, and at last to drive Heathcliff away. Years passed. Heathcliff returned a rich man--and found Cathy had married Edgar. Like a sullen demon, the gypsy vowed to ruin Wuthering Heights and the Grange, to plague his tormentors, to relentlessly hound and ruin the Earnshaws, the Lintons, even their children--until he won back the woman he loved.

Each timeless myth is superbly presented in story form and enhanced with original art work by world-renowned artist Giovanni Caselli. Though Bulfinch's has been heralded for more than a century, it has never been published in so beautiful and accessible a format. Evocative four-color illustrations, many full-page, bring to life key events and characters of these universal tales and sagas -- from the Greek and Roman pantheon of gods to the heroes of the Crusades, from the exploits of Robin Hood to the feats of Richard the Lionheart. As enjoyable now as when Bulfinch first assembled them, these selections come from a variety of works -- Ovid's classic Metamorphoses, Egyptian myths, Eastern mythology, and Hindu, Norse, and Celtic sources. Together they form a remarkable tapestry of human endeavor: dreams, illusions, adventures, loves lost and loves found. In this handsome series, they speak to us afresh, across the ages, vivified through Caselli's inspired art.

'What I touch, what resists me - that is what I understand' As Camus argues, if there is no God to give meaning to our lives, humans must take on that purpose themselves. This is our 'absurd' task, like Sisyphus condemned forever to roll a rock up a hill. Written during the bleakest days of the Second World War, The Myth of Sisyphus argues for an acceptance of reality that encompasses revolt, passion and, above all, liberty, gained through an awareness of pure existence. This volume contains several other essays, including lyrical evocations of the sunlit cities of Algiers and Oran, the settings of his great novels The Outsider and The Plague. The writings in this volume are all, in their own way, hymns to the physical world and the elemental pleasures of living.

The book is characterized by Carpenter's distinctive literary style, which seamlessly blends rigorous scholarly analysis with poetic prose. Set against the backdrop of late 19th-century thought, Carpenter challenges prevailing religious doctrines by examining their roots in ancient beliefs and practices, inviting readers to reflect on the complexities of spiritual evolution and human experience. Edward Carpenter was a multi-faceted figure'Äîpoet, social reformer, and a pioneer of early LGBTQ+ rights'Äîwhose own life experiences deeply informed his work. His exposure to various philosophical traditions and his commitment to social justice spurred his inquiry into the origins of religious beliefs. Carpenter's unique perspective as an advocate for both spiritual and social liberation reflects his quest to reconcile the often disparate spheres of pagan and Christian ideologies, fostering a more inclusive understanding of spirituality. This book is essential for readers interested in religious studies, history, and philosophy. Carpenter's insightful examination encourages an open-minded approach to the coexistence of belief systems, prompting readers to question and reevaluate their own understandings of faith. Its eloquent prose and rich historical context make it a rewarding read for both scholars and general audiences.",George Allen & Unwin,Good Press,Theology,Religion,Hardback,102446,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FrjCDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,100,GoogleBooks

Why are humans one of the few species to have sex in private? Why do humans have sex any day of the month or year, including when the female is pregnant, beyond her reproductive years, or between her fertile cycles? Why are human females one of the few mammals to go through menopause? Human sexuality seems normal to us but it is bizarre by the standards of other animals. Jared Diamond argues that our strange sex lives were as crucial to our rise to human status as were our large brains. He also describes the battle of the sexes in the human and animal world over parental care, and why sex differences in the genetic value of parental care provide a biological basis for the all-too-familiar different attitudes of men and women towards extramarital sex.",Wiedenfeld & Nicolson,Hachette UK,Sex,Science,Paperback,101085,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mi_vAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,100,GoogleBooks

The Folly has no rival, except perhaps Thomas More's Utopia, as the most intense and lively presentation of the literary, social, and theological aims and methods of Northern Humanism. Clarence H. Miller's highly praised translation of The Praise of Folly, based on the definitive Latin text, echoes Erasmus' own lively style while retaining the nuances of the original text. In his introduction, Miller places the work in the context of Erasmus as humanist and theologian. In a new afterword, William H. Gass playfully considers the meaning, or meanings, of folly and offers fresh insights into one of the great books of Western literature.

Just as ominously, especially for those who share the values and views of Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, at no other time have religious fundamentalists effectively had veto power over one of the country's two major political parties. As Sean Faircloth argues in this deeply sobering yet highly engaging book, this has led to the crumbling of the country's most cherished founding principle—the wall of separation between church and state. While much of the public debate in the United States over church-state issues has focused on the construction of nativity scenes in town squares and the addition of ""under God"" to the Pledge of Allegiance, former politician and lobbyist Faircloth moves beyond the symbolism to explore the many ways federal and state legal codes privilege religion in law. He demonstrates in vivid detail how religious bias in law harms all Americans—financially, militarily, physically, socially, and educationally—and directs special attention to the outlandish words, views, and policy proposals of the most theocratic politicians. Sounding a much-needed alarm for all who care about the future direction of the country, Faircloth concludes by offering an inspiring 10-point vision of an America returned to its secular roots and by providing a specific and sensible plan for realizing this vision.",United States of America,Pitchstone Publishing (US&CA),Secularism,Religion,,104767,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FgyeCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,100,GoogleBooks

The book delves into the life and teachings of one of the most influential figures in human history, proposing a provocative reassessment of his actions and words. Floyd adopts a literary style that is both analytical and accessible, placing the work within the literary context of theological critique and historical analysis. His careful attention to detail and the broader implications of Jesus's purported mistakes challenge long-standing orthodoxies and invite reflection on the underlying messages in religious texts. William Floyd, a writer who is no stranger to controversy, approaches the subject matter with a perspective informed by extensive research and a willingness to question established beliefs. This work appears to be an extension of his philosophical quest for understanding complex religious constructs and their impact on society. Floyd's background perhaps suggests a personal journey to reconcile faith with the intellectual pursuit of truth, which lends his writing an authenticity that is both engaging and thought-provoking. 'The Mistakes of Jesus' is not merely a scholarly pursuit but a provocative piece of literature that calls into question the infallibility of divine figures.

The discussion then shifts to the evolutionary aspect of human life existence.

In this new edition of The Great Code, Alvin A. Lee presents a corrected and fully annotated version of Frye's text, as well as a comprehensive introduction to help contextualize this important work and guide readers through its allusive passages. Lee's introduction provides a synoptic account of the role of the Bible in Frye's intellectual and spiritual odyssey, as well as a description of how The Great Code as a book came into existence, and an introductory critique of the shape and meaning of the book's argument. The Great Code is culturally allusive to a high degree. It takes much of its inspiration from the Bible itself, including a profusion of biblical passages, but also from the author's extensive reading of a host of other texts from ancient times until the late twentieth century. Lee's extensive annotation illustrates, beyond question, that Frye's knowledge of the Bible and how it has worked in Western culture was at once profound and visionary. This new edition not only re-presents Frye's text in a clear, correct, and fully annotated form, it goes a long way in helping us understand the widespread scholarly and popular reception that met this extraordinary and in some ways revolutionary book and how it can still be richly rewarding for readers.",ARK Paperbacks,University of Toronto Press,Bible / Literature,Literary Collections,,,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Lb_Rq66W4g0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,100,GoogleBooks

In The Foundations of New Testament Christology, R.H. Fuller fulfils this task through a close examination of the first-century texts in both their Palestinian and Hellenistic contexts. An exponent of the neo-orthodox position that dominated post-war scholarship in the field, central to Fuller's argument is the 'traditio-historical' approach to New Testament criticism. As Fuller sees it, 'the Church's Christology was a response to its total encounter with Jesus, not only in his earthly history but also in the Church's continuing life'. By emphasising the continuity between the historical Jesus and the witness and message of the early post-resurrection church, he offers a comprehensive and thorough survey of this most important facet of exegesis.""",Collins,James Clarke & Company,Christology,Religion,,101301,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jVV-EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,100,GoogleBooks

This, Jim Garrison argues, is the single greatest question of our age. The dangers need no emphasizing, and have already been starkly portrayed in his From Hiroshima to Harrisburg. Here the foCus shifts from scientific and political questions to the theological dimension. God, Dr Garrison argues, is in Hiroshima as he is in other saving events in history. The development symbolized by Hiroshima directs our attention beyond narrow sectional interest to the source of life which creates and sustains us all. God is at work even in the atom bomb, calling us to a transformation of consciousness and understanding. Hiroshima confronts us as never before with the demand that we should take the wrath of God seriously. God is the Go, d of all possibilities. And at the same time, we have taken upon ourselves that which the traditional view left in God's hands alone: the determination of apocalyptic judgment. This means that we must internalize theologically both the terror and the salvation of the traditional Judaeo-Christian concept of apocalypse as something that will not be done to us by divine fiat alone, but as something that might well be done by us through our own decision, God working divine wrath through our arrogance. - How Hiroshima, apocalyptic, and the darkness of God at work in Christ crucified are related together form the theme of one of the most powerful pieces of theology of our time.",SCM Press,,Religion / Catastrophe,Religion,,103164,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WdplAAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,100,GoogleBooks

Since their earliest discovery in 1947, the Scrolls have been the object of fascination and extreme controversy. Challenging traditional dogma, Golb has been the leading proponent of the view that the Scrolls cannot be the work of a small, desert-dwelling fringe sect, as various earlier scholars had claimed, but are in all likelihood the remains of libraries of various Jewish groups, smuggled out of Jerusalem and hidden in desert caves during the Roman siege of 70 A. D. Contributing to the enduring debate sparked by the book's original publication in 1995, this digital edition contains additional material reporting on new developments that have led a series of major Israeli and European archaeologists to support Golb's basic conclusions. In its second half, the book offers a detailed analysis of the workings of the scholarly monopoly that controlled the Scrolls for many years, and discusses Golb's role in the struggle to make the texts available to the public. Pleading for an end to academic politics and a commitment to the search for truth in scrolls scholarship, Who Wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls? sets a new standard for studies in intertestamental history ""This book is 'must reading'.... It demonstrates how a particular interpretation of an ancient site and particular readings of ancient documents became a straitjacket for subsequent discussion of what is arguably the most widely publicized set of discoveries in the history of biblical archaeology...."" Dr. Gregory T. Armstrong, 'Church History' Golb ""gives us much more than just a fresh and convincing interpretation of the origin and significance of the Qumran Scrolls. His book is also... a fascinating case-study of how an idee fixe, for which there is no real historical justification, has for over 40 years dominated an elite coterie of scholars controlling the Scrolls....""

In fact, John Gribbin reveals, our seemingly random universe is actually built on simple laws of cause and effect that can explain why, for example, just one vehicle braking can cause a traffic jam; why wild storms result from a slight atmospheric change; even how we evolved from the most basic materials.

Such a task entailed a prolonged study, not only of scientific literature, but also of works that belong to neighbouring provinces. The information gleaned from these fields had then to be appraised and put together, and an effort made to reduce it into a harmonious system. In doing this the various theories had to be examined with discrimination, enlarged, and built into the structure. It is, therefore, hoped that the reader will meet many new thoughts in the work. In the preparatory reading the author had to go through the whole of the relevant literature in various languages. In the book itself he was compelled to restrict himself to what had an essential bearing - either for or against - on the view it presents. The work has not been written solely for those who are entirely devoted to the study of science. About the Publisher Forgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.

It seeks to deal connectedly with the general problems of biology, in strict accord with the monistic and mechanical principles which had been laid down by the author in 1866 in his work titled, General Morphology. In the latter publication, special stress was placed on the universality of the law of substance and the substantial unity of nature, which had been further treated in the second and fourteenth chapters of The Riddle of the Universe.

The present work on the wonders of life is, as the title indicates, a supplementary volume to The Riddle of the Universe. While the latter undertook to make a comprehensive survey of the general questions of science--as cosmological problems--in the light of the monistic philosophy, the present volume is confined to the realm of organic science, or the science of life. It seeks to deal connectedly with the general problems of biology, in strict accord with the monistic and mechanical principles which had been laid down by the author in 1866 in his work titled, General Morphology. In the latter publication, special stress was placed on the universality of the law of substance and the substantial unity of nature, which had been further treated in the second and fourteenth chapters of The Riddle of the Universe. The arrangement of the vast material for this study of the wonders of life was modeled on that of the Riddle. Retained in the present volume is the division into larger and smaller sections and the synopses of the various chapters. Thus the whole biological content falls into four sections and twenty chapters""--Preface.

A wonder book and Tanglewood Tales,A Wonder Book and Tanglewood Tales,Nathaniel Hawthorne,Nathaniel Hawthorne,1906,2020-08-25,,"9390027802, 9789390027804",,328,,"The stories in A Wonder-Book for Girls and Boys are all stories within a story, the frame story being that a Williams College student, Eustace Bright, is telling these tales to a group of children at Tanglewood, an area in Lenox, Massachusetts, where Hawthorne lived for a time. All the tales are modified from the original myths. A Wonder-Book for Girls and Boys covers the myths of The Gorgon's Head - recounts the story of Perseus killing Medusa at the request of the king of the island, Polydectes. The Golden Touch - recounts the story of King Midas and his ""Golden Touch"". The Paradise of Children - recounts the story of Pandora opening the box filled with all of mankind's Troubles. The Three Golden Apples - recounts the story of Heracles procuring the Three Golden Apples from the Hesperides' orchard, with the help of Atlas. The Miraculous Pitcher - recounts the story of Baucis and Philemon providing food and shelter to two strangers who were Zeus and ""Quicksilver"" (Hermes) in disguise. Baucis and Philemon were rewarded by the gods for their kindness; they were promised never to live apart from one another. The Chimæra - recounts the story of Bellerophon taming Pegasus and killing the Chimæra. The book includes the myths of: Theseus and the Minotaur (Chapter: ""The Minotaur"") Antaeus and the Pygmies (Chapter: ""The Pygmies"") Dragon's Teeth (Chapter: ""The Dragon's Teeth"") Circe's Palace (Chapter: ""Circe's Palace"") Proserpina, Ceres, Pluto, and the Pomegranate Seed (Chapter: ""The Pomegranate Seed"") Jason and the Golden Fleece (Chapter: ""The Golden Fleece"") Hawthorne wrote an introduction, titled ""The Wayside"", referring to The Wayside in Concord, where he lived from 1852 until his death. In the introduction, Hawthorne writes about a visit from his young friend Eustace Bright, who requested a sequel to A Wonder-Book, which impelled him to write the Tales. Although Hawthorne informs us in the introduction that these stories were also later retold by Cousin Eustace, the frame stories of A Wonder-Book have been abandoned. Hawthorne wrote the first book while renting a small cottage in the Berkshires, a vacation area for industrialists during the Gilded Age. The owner of the cottage, a railroad baron, renamed the cottage ""Tanglewood"" in honor of the book written there. Later, a nearby mansion was renamed Tanglewood, where outdoor classical concerts were held, which became a Berkshire summer tradition. Ironically, Hawthorne hated living in the Berkshires. The Tanglewood neighborhood of Houston was named after the book. The book was a favorite of Mary Catherine Farrington, the daughter of Tanglewood developer William Farrington. It reportedly inspired the name of the thickly wooded Tanglewood Island in the state of Washington.",J.M.

Taking the question 'Is there such a subject?' as his point of departure, the author sets out to explore the relation between theology and the broader field of religious studies. Theology primarily means 'rational talk about God', but the word is used in other wider and looser senses as well. Mr Hebblethwaite discusses in what ways it is possible for non-believers to engage in theology, and stresses the need for all to pursue the subject openly and self-critically in a religiously pluralist world. Criteria for truth-claims in religion and the problem of revelation are among the topics examined. In the course of his study the author looks at the relationship between theology and a number of adjacent subjects: psychology and the social sciences, philosophy, history and ethics.",Cambridge University Press,CUP Archive,Theology,Religion,,106176,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lrQ8AAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,100,GoogleBooks

Like civilization, play requires structure and participants willing to create within limits. Starting with Plato, Huizinga traces the contribution of Homo Ludens, or “man the player” through Medieval Times, the Renaissance, and into our modern civilization.

While all three agree that a god exists, they differ sharply in opinion on God's nature or attributes and how, or if, humankind can come to knowledge of a deity. In the Dialogues, Hume's characters debate a number of arguments for the existence of God, and arguments whose proponents believe through which we may come to know the nature of God.

Many considered Huxley's book a popularization of the ideas then emerging in evolutionary biology, but in fact Evolution: The Modern Synthesis is a work of serious scholarship that is also accessible to the general educated public. It is a book in the intellectual tradition of Charles Darwin and Thomas Henry Huxley--Julian Huxley's grandfather, known for his energetic championing of Darwin's ideas. A contemporary reviewer called Evolution: The Modern Synthesis the outstanding evolutionary treatise of the decade, perhaps the century. This definitive edition brings one of the most important and successful scientific books of the twentieth century back into print. It includes the entire text of the 1942 edition, Huxley's introduction to the 1963 second edition (which demonstrates his continuing command of the field), and the introduction to the 1974 third edition, written by nine experts (many of them Huxley's associates) from different areas of evolutionary biology.",George Allen & Unwin,,Evolution,Evolution (Biology).,Hardback,104589,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FxtFAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,100,GoogleBooks

It also feels the need to introduce the reader to the idea of religious ""arcana,"" that some concepts were once deemed fit only for select and secret ears, and then proceeds to cheerfully reveal some of those secrets, such as the phallicism of church steeples and spires.With the assistance of numerous charming illustrations, Inman introduces his 19th-century readers to the metaphorical links between Christianity and the civilizations of the ancient world-India, Babylonia, Assyria, Egypt, and others-from shared abstract figures of stars and crosses to nature symbology (fish, trees) to particular arrangements of the human figures in religious portraits that cross cultures. But it is the author's enchanting handholding that makes this work so appealing today: it speaks to a new enthusiasm among the public for an approach to religion-and religion as mythology-that is rational, logical, and beginning to approach the modern.British doctor and mythologist (1820-1876) is also the author of Ancient Faiths Embodied in Ancient Names as well as several books on hygiene.",Peter Eckler,"Cosimo, Inc.",Symbolism,Religion,Hardback,101734,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ahAe5g3SEbsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,100,GoogleBooks

The Idea of God in Early Religions,The Idea of God in Early Religions,F B Jevons,F B Jevons,1911,2024-04-23,,"1835917194, 9781835917190",170,0,,"""The Idea of God in Early Religions"" by F. B. Jevons is a significant work that explores the concept of divinity across various ancient civilizations and religious traditions. Published in 1910, this book examines the development of religious thought and the evolution of beliefs about the divine in the early stages of human civilization. F. B. Jevons, a British classicist and theologian, presents a comparative study of religious ideas and practices from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, India, Greece, and other cultures. He traces the origins of religious consciousness and investigates how different societies conceptualized and worshiped their gods. One of the central themes of the book is the exploration of the human impulse to seek meaning and transcendence through religious experience. Jevons examines the ways in which early humans interpreted natural phenomena, such as the cycles of the sun and the changing seasons, and attributed divine significance to them. Moreover, Jevons analyzes the diversity of religious beliefs and practices, highlighting common themes and motifs that emerge across cultures. He discusses the roles of priests, rituals, myths, and sacred texts in shaping religious worldviews and fostering communal identity. Another key aspect of ""The Idea of God in Early Religions"" is its investigation into the development of monotheism from polytheistic and henotheistic roots. Jevons explores the emergence of monotheistic concepts in ancient Egypt, Israel, and other civilizations, tracing the evolution of the idea of a single, supreme deity. Jevons' book provides valuable insights into the early stages of religious thought and the formation of the idea of God in human history. It offers a scholarly examination of the richness and diversity of religious beliefs and practices in ancient societies, contributing to our understanding of the origins of religious consciousness.",Cambridge University Press,,Religioun / Anthropology,Religion,Hardback,101752,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tZ6z0AEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,100,GoogleBooks

Right up there with In Cold Blood and The Executioner’s Song.” —San Francisco Chronicle Defying both civil authorities and the Mormon establishment in Salt Lake City, the renegade leaders of these Taliban-like theocracies are zealots who answer only to God; some 40,000 people still practice polygamy in these communities. At the core of Krakauer’s book are brothers Ron and Dan Lafferty, who insist they received a commandment from God to kill a blameless woman and her baby girl. Beginning with a meticulously researched account of this appalling double murder, Krakauer constructs a multi-layered, bone-chilling narrative of messianic delusion, polygamy, savage violence, and unyielding faith. Along the way he uncovers a shadowy offshoot of America’s fastest growing religion, and raises provocative questions about the nature of religious belief.",,Anchor,Religion,True Crime,,104457,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0DQaTU7Opq0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,100,GoogleBooks

Doing Good Better,Doing Good Better,William MaCaskill,William MacAskill,2015,2015-07-28,,"9780698191105, 0698191102",,288,Effective altruism,"Most of us want to make a difference. We donate our time and money to charities and causes we deem worthy, choose careers we consider meaningful, and patronize businesses and buy products we believe make the world a better place. Unfortunately, we often base these decisions on assumptions and emotions rather than facts. As a result, even our best intentions often lead to ineffective—and sometimes downright harmful—outcomes. How can we do better? While a researcher at Oxford, trying to figure out which career would allow him to have the greatest impact, William MacAskill confronted this problem head on. He discovered that much of the potential for change was being squandered by lack of information, bad data, and our own prejudice. As an antidote, he and his colleagues developed effective altruism, a practical, data-driven approach that allows each of us to make a tremendous difference regardless of our resources. Effective altruists believe that it’s not enough to simply do good; we must do good better. At the core of this philosophy are five key questions that help guide our altruistic decisions: How many people benefit, and by how much? Is this the most effective thing I can do? Is this area neglected? What would have happened otherwise? What are the chances of success, and how good would success be? By applying these questions to real-life scenarios, MacAskill shows how many of our assumptions about doing good are misguided. For instance, he argues one can potentially save more lives by becoming a plastic surgeon rather than a heart surgeon; measuring overhead costs is an inaccurate gauge of a charity’s effectiveness; and, it generally doesn’t make sense for individuals to donate to disaster relief. MacAskill urges us to think differently, set aside biases, and use evidence and careful reasoning rather than act on impulse. When we do this—when we apply the head and the heart to each of our altruistic endeavors—we find that each of us has the power to do an astonishing amount of good.",Guardian Books Kings Place London,Penguin,Philosophy,Social Science,,106620,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sAgbBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,100,GoogleBooks

This Harriman House edition includes Charles Mackay's account of the three infamous financial manias - John Law's Mississipi Scheme, the South Sea Bubble, and Tulipomania.Between the three of them, these historic episodes confirm that greed and fear have always been the driving forces of financial markets, and, furthermore, that being sensible and clever is no defence against the mesmeric allure of a popular craze with the wind behind it.In writing the history of the great financial manias, Charles Mackay proved himself a master chronicler of social as well as financial history. Blessed with a cast of characters that covered all the vices, gifted a passage of events which was inevitably heading for disaster, and with the benefit of hindsight, he produced a record that is at once a riveting thriller and absorbing historical document. A century and a half later, it is as vibrant and lurid as the day it was written.For modern-day investors, still reeling from the dotcom crash, the moral of the popular manias scarcely needs spelling out. When the next stock market bubble comes along, as it surely will, you are advised to recall the plight of some of the unfortunates on these pages, and avoid getting dragged under the wheels of the careering bandwagon yourself.",Farrar Straus & Giroux,Harriman House Limited,Psychology,Business & Economics,Paperback,103342,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t8xjAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,100,GoogleBooks

The two first of these three Essays were written between the years 1850 and 1858, during the period which intervened between the publication of the Principles of Political Economy, and that of the work on Liberty; during which interval three other Essays - on Justice, on Utility, and on Liberty - were also composed. Of the five Essays written at that time, three have already been given to the public by the Author. That on Liberty was expanded into the now well-known work bearing the same title. Those on Justice and Utility were afterwards incorporated, with some alterations and additions, into one, and published under the name of Utilitarianism.

Principles of Political Economy (1848) by John Stuart Mill was one of the most important economics or political economy textbooks of the mid-nineteenth century. It was revised until its seventh edition in 1871, shortly before Mill's death in 1873, and republished in numerous other editions. In every department of human affairs, Practice long precedes Science systematic enquiry into the modes of action of the powers of nature, is the tardy product of a long course of efforts to use those powers for practical ends. The conception, accordingly, of Political Economy as a branch of science is extremely modern; but the subject with which its enquiries are conversant has in all ages necessarily constituted one of the chief practical interests of mankind, and, in some, a most unduly engrossing one. That subject is Wealth. Writers on Political Economy profess to teach, or to investigate, the nature of Wealth, and the laws of its production and distribution: including, directly or remotely, the operation of all the causes by which the condition of mankind, or of any society of human beings, in respect to this universal object of human desire, is made prosperous or the reverse. Not that any treatise on Political Economy can discuss or even enumerate all these causes; but it undertakes to set forth as much as is known of the laws and principles according to which they operate.",,,Political / Economy,,,103366,,Lending,,100,GoogleBooks

The essay first appeared as a series of three articles published in Fraser's Magazine in 1861; the articles were collected and reprinted as a single book in 1863. Mill's aim in the book is to explain what utilitarianism is, to show why it is the best theory of ethics, and to defend it against a wide range of criticisms and misunderstandings. Though heavily criticized both in Mill's lifetime and in the years since, Utilitarianism did a great deal to popularize utilitarian ethics and was ""the most influential philosophical articulation of a liberal humanistic morality that was produced in the nineteenth century.""Mill took many elements of his version of utilitarianism from Jeremy Bentham, the great nineteenth-century legal reformer, who along with William Paley were the two most influential English utilitarians prior to Mill. Like Bentham, Mill believed that happiness (or pleasure, which both Bentham and Mill equated with happiness) was the only thing humans do and should desire for its own sake. Since happiness is the only intrinsic good, and since more happiness is preferable to less, the goal of the ethical life is to maximize happiness. This is what Bentham and Mill call ""the principle of utility"" or ""the greatest-happiness principle."" Both Bentham and Mill thus endorse ""classical"" or ""hedonistic"" forms of utilitarianism. More recent utilitarians often deny that happiness is the sole intrinsic good, arguing that a variety of values and consequences should be considered in ethical decision making.Although Mill agreed with Bentham about many of the foundational principles of ethics, he also had some major disagreements. In particular, Mill tried to develop a more refined form of utilitarianism that would harmonize better with ordinary morality and highlight the importance in the ethical life of intellectual pleasures, self-development, high ideals of character, and conventional moral rules.In Chapter 1, titled ""General Remarks,"" Mill notes that there has been little progress in ethics. Since the beginning of philosophy, the same issues have been debated over and over again, and philosophers continue to disagree sharply over the basic starting points of ethics. Mill argues that these philosophical disputes have not seriously damaged popular morality, largely because conventional morality is substantially, though implicitly, utilitarian. He concludes the chapter by noting that he will not attempt to give a strict ""proof"" of the greatest-happiness principle. Like Bentham, Mill believed that ultimate ends and first principles cannot be demonstrated, since they lie at the foundation of everything else that we know and believe. Nevertheless, he claims, ""considerations may be presented capable of determining the intellect,"" which amount to something close to a proof of the principle of utility.",,,,,,104323,,Reference,,100,GoogleBooks

But why are some nations more creative than others, and why do some highly innovative societies--such as ancient China, or Britain in the industrial revolution--pass into stagnation? Beginning with a fascinating, concise history of technological progress, Mokyr sets the background for his analysis by tracing the major inventions and innovations that have transformed society since ancient Greece and Rome. What emerges from this survey is often surprising: the classical world, for instance, was largely barren of new technology, the relatively backward society of medieval Europe bristled with inventions, and the period between the Reformation and the Industrial Revolution was one of slow and unspectacular progress in technology, despite the tumultuous developments associated with the Voyages of Discovery and the Scientific Revolution. What were the causes of technological creativity? Mokyr distinguishes between the relationship of inventors and their physical environment--which determined their willingness to challenge nature--and the social environment, which determined the openness to new ideas. He discusses a long list of such factors, showing how they interact to help or hinder a nation's creativity, and then illustrates them by a number of detailed comparative studies, examining the differences between Europe and China, between classical antiquity and medieval Europe, and between Britain and the rest of Europe during the industrial revolution. He examines such aspects as the role of the state (the Chinese gave up a millennium-wide lead in shipping to the Europeans, for example, when an Emperor banned large ocean-going vessels), the impact of science, as well as religion, politics, and even nutrition. He questions the importance of such commonly-cited factors as the spill-over benefits of war, the abundance of natural resources, life expectancy, and labor costs. Today, an ever greater number of industrial economies are competing in the global market, locked in a struggle that revolves around technological ingenuity. The Lever of Riches, with its keen analysis derived from a sweeping survey of creativity throughout history, offers telling insights into the question of how Western economies can maintain, and developing nations can unlock, their creative potential.",,Oxford University Press,Economics / Development,Business & Economics,,102319,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9i1u11Y3wDIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,100,GoogleBooks

After complaining to her teachers about her Maths lessons being replaced by Koran study, Marina was arrested late one evening. She was taken to the notorious prison, Evin, where interrogation and torture were part of the daily routine. Aged sixteen, she was sentenced to death. Her prison guard snatched her from the firing squad bullets but exacted a shocking price in return: marriage to him and conversion to Islam. Marina lived out her prison days as his secret bride, spending nights with him in a separate cell. Marina struggled to reconcile her hatred towards Ali and her feelings of physical repulsion with the fact that he had saved her life. When Ali was murdered by his enemies from Evin, and saved Marina's life for a second time, her feelings were complicated even further. At last she was able to return home, to her family and her past life, but silence surrounded her time as a political prisoner and the regime kept her under constant surveillance. Marina's world had been changed forever and she questions whether she will ever escape Iran and its regime or be free of her memories of Evin.",,Hachette UK,Islam,Biography & Autobiography,,104548,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2DxE832yTf8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,100,GoogleBooks

Nietzsche's works together make a unique statement in the literature of European ideas' A. C.

It describes how the ancient Persian prophet Zarathustra descends from his solitude in the mountains to tell the world that God is dead and that the Superman, the human embodiment of divinity, is his successor. With blazing intensity, Nietzsche argues that the meaning of existence is not to be found in religious pieties or meek submission, but in an all-powerful life force: passionate, chaotic and free.

The dead sea scrolls and the bible,The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Bible,Charles F. Pfeiffer,Charles F. Pfeiffer,1969,1969,,UOM:49015001243725,,168,,"""Since the spring of 1947, when ancient manuscripts which came to be known as the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered in the Judean wilderness, scholars have been debating their origins and dates, attempting to place them in their proper historical context and searching other cave finds which might give them further enlightenment on pre-Christian Judaism. In this volume on Dead Sea Scrolls and the Qumran Community, Charles F. Pfeiffer relates the dramatic story of how the Scrolls were found and what they contain. Less than three centuries after Christ, the church father Origen mentioned Greek and Hebrew manuscripts which were found stored in jars in the region of Jericho. But this could not be confirmed until seventeen centuries later, when an Arab lad herding sheep or goats in the area entered a cave—perhaps in pursuit of a stray goat, perhaps taking refuge from a sudden thunderstorm, perhaps while smuggling goods across the Jordan to Bethlehem—and came upon the documents, which he tried to sell in the marketplace. How two buyers each brought part of the lot without realizing who had the other part, how one buyer tried to sell his acquisition in the United States before ceding it to the State of Israel, how archeologists were inspired to explore other caves and how their digs in eleven caves produced at least four hundred additional manuscripts—all of these facts provide a fascinating insight into what Professor Frank Cross has called ""the ultimate in jigsaw puzzles. Certain myths and legends are dispelled: although Qumran has been reported to be the site of Gomorrah, the location has been proved to be wrong, and it is more likely that it was a Roman military outpost. In any case, the civilization which existed there was a highly developed one: inkwells with dried ink point to learned scribes who apparently copied the manuscripts and had them in their possession when they saw their homes about to be destroyed by Roman legions. Through the excavations of the ruins the whole history of Jews was reconstituted: the idol worship of the pre-exile period; the influence of the Hellenism during the time of Alexander the Great; the scourge of venality in the days when priesthoods were openly bought and sold; the guerrilla war with Syria and the subsequent cleansing of the Temple by Judas, still celebrated in the feast of Hanukkah; the origins of the Hassidim, who supported religious liberty but not nationalism; the evolution of sects such as the Pharisees, the Sadducees and the Essenes. The author traces the background of customs such as common meals and explains the origin of water purification and common property laws. the reader can learn the true meaning of the scroll: ""The War Between the Children of Light and the Children of Darkness,"" and be informed that the Jewish religion, unlike other theologies, considered the one and omnipotent God to be the author of both good and evil, master of the world. In short, this is an invaluable handbook for the historian, theologian, the archeologist and indeed for any curious reader.""-Publisher.",Baker Book House,Gramercy,Christianity,Dead Sea scrolls,,106549,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gzkNAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,100,GoogleBooks

Symposium: Here Plato depicts a group of Athenian intellectuals discussing the nature of desire.

Page The Enneads is the collection of writings of Plotinus, edited and compiled by his student Porphyry (c. AD 270). Plotinus was a student of Ammonius Saccas and they were founders of Neoplatonism. His work, through Augustine of Hippo, the Cappadocian Fathers, Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite and several subsequent Christian and Muslim thinkers, has greatly influenced Western and Near-Eastern thought. Porphyry edited the writings of Plotinus in fifty-four treatises, which vary greatly in length and number of chapters, mostly because he split original texts and joined others together to match this very number. Then, he proceeded to set the fifty-four treatises in groups of nine (Greek. ennea) or Enneads. He also collected The Enneads into three volumes. The first volume contained the first three Enneads (I, II, III), the second volume has the Fourth (IV) and the Fifth (V) Enneads, and the last volume was devoted to the remaining Enneads. After correcting and naming each treatise, Porphyry wrote a biography of his master, Life of Plotinus, intended to be an Introduction to the Enneads. Porphyry's edition does not follow the chronological order in which Enneads were written (see Chronological Listing below), but responds to a plan of study which leads the learner from subjects related to his own affairs to subjects concerning the uttermost principles of the universe. Although not exclusively, Porphyry tells us (Cf. Life of Plotinus, chapters.24-26) that the First Ennead deals with Human or ethical topics, the Second and Third Enneads are mostly devoted to cosmological subjects or physical reality, the Fourth concerns the Soul, the Fifth knowledge and intelligible reality, and finally the Sixth covers Being and what is above it, the One or first principle of all.",Encyclopedia Brittanica,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,Plotinus,,Hardback,102727,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7q2TtAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,100,GoogleBooks

Known as Objectivism, her divisive philosophy holds human life—the life proper to a rational being—as the standard of moral values and regards altruism as incompatible with man's nature.

His major work, The Martyrdom of Man (1872), is a secular history of the Western world. According to one historian, the book became a kind of ""substitute bible for secularists"". In it, Reade attempts to trace the development of Western civilization in terms analogous to those used in the natural sciences.

This is the perfect gift for the fearless literary connoisseur who values creativity, big ideas and revolutionary spirit. Considered “the Voltaire of his time”, Bertrand Russell was a fearless iconoclast who stood unbowed before political and religious leaders; his disdain for conventional thinking and accepted beliefs set him apart from his academic peers and at odds with the authorities throughout his long and storied life. Russell’s penetrating insights and exquisite turns of phrase feel as fresh and relevant today as when they were first written. Arguing that we can achieve far more by doing far less, and that traditional wealth accumulation is a form of cultural and moral poverty, Russell demands greater depth from our age of abundant creativity and heralds the next wave of enlightened entrepreneurs. Bertrand Arthur William Russell, 3rd Earl Russell, OM, FRS was a Welsh philosopher, logician, mathematician, historian, writer, social critic and political activist. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1950. New York Times bestselling author Bradley Trevor Greive ​(BTG) became a​ household name ​after writing The Blue Day Book.​ ​He​ has since gone on to become one of the world’s most successful humour authors​, and his books have​​ sold more than 2​5 million copies ​in​ 2​9​ languages​ and ​115 countrie​s​.

After graduating from The Royal Military College​,​ BTG served as a Paratrooper Platoon Commander in the Australian Army​ before starting his​ publishing career as a cartoonist with​ the Sydney Morning Herald​.

He argues that ""To understand the war, we must understand America""-and, in doing so, we must understand that racism in the United States created a climate in which it was difficult for Americans to understand what they were doing in Vietnam. According to Russell, it was this same racism that provoked ""a barbarous, chauvinist outcry when American pilots who have bombed hospitals, schools, dykes, and civilian centres are accused of committing war crimes."" Even today, more than forty years later, this chauvinist moral blindness permitted John McCain to run for President effectively unchallenged when he gloried in his exploits in bombing the Vietnamese.",George Allen & Unwin,NYU Press,Vietnam War,History,Paperback,103585,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WtJWCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,100,GoogleBooks

In this extraordinary book, Dr. Oliver Sacks recounts the stories of patients struggling to adapt to often bizarre worlds of neurological disorder. Here are people who can no longer recognize everyday objects or those they love; who are stricken with violent tics or shout involuntary obscenities, and yet are gifted with unusually acute artistic or mathematical talents. If sometimes beyond our surface comprehension, these brilliant tales illuminate what it means to be human.

Billions and Billions,Billions and Billions,Carl Sagan,Carl Sagan,1997,1997,,UOM:39015041078299,246,264,,"In this book, his last, Carl Sagan shows once again his extraordinary ability to interpret the mysteries of life and the majesty of the universe for the general reader. Brilliant, eloquent, and imbued with Sagan's uniquely childlike sense of awe, this entertaining collection of essays captures the authors spirit at its best. In Billions and Billions Sagan applies what we know about science, mathematics, and space to everyday life, as well as to the exploration of many essential questions concerning the environment and our future. Ranging far and wide in subject matter, he takes his readers on a soaring journey, from the invention of chess to the possibility of life on Mars, from Monday Night Football to the relationship between the United States and Russia, from global warming to the abortion debate. And, on a more intimate note, we are given a rare glimpse of the author himself as he movingly describes his valiant fight for his life, his love of his family, and his personal beliefs about death and God. Throughout these essays, Sagan provides clarity and understanding for an audience eager to make sense of the world around it as it prepares for the challenges of the coming millennium, and in the process he illuminates his strongly held belief that we have the ability to change the world and our lives for the better. Sagan has said, We make our world significant by the courage of our questions and by the depth of our answers. With this book, as in his magnificent career, he makes this world significant indeed.",Headline Books,Random House (NY),Science,Science,Hardback,104106,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tsbaAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,100,GoogleBooks

The life of reason,The Life of Reason,George Santayana,George Santayana,1954,2011,,"9780262016742, 0262016745",,403,,"Santayana's Life of Reason, published in five books from 1905 to 1906, ranks as one of the greatest works in modern philosophical naturalism. Acknowledging the natural material bases of human life, Santayana traces the development of the human capacity for appreciating and cultivating the ideal. It is a capacity he exhibits as he articulates a continuity running through animal impulse, practical intelligence, and ideal harmony in reason, society, art, religion, and science. The work is an exquisitely rendered vision of human life lived sanely. In this first book of the work, Santayana provides an account of how the human animal develops instinct, passion, and chaotic experience into rationality and ideal life. Inspired by Aristotle's De Anima, Darwin's evolutionary theory, and William James's The Principles of Psychology, Santayana contends that the requirements of action in a hazardous and uncertain environment are the sources of the development of mind. More specifically, instinct and imagination are crucial to the emergence of reason from chaos. Separating himself from the typical thought of the time by his recognition of the imagination, Santayana in this volume offers extensive critiques of various philosophies of mind, including those of Kant and the British empiricists. This Critical Edition, volume VII of The Works of George Santayana, includes a chronology, notes, bibliography, textual commentary, lists of variants, and other tools useful to Santayana scholars.",Constable and Company,MIT Press,Philosophy,Art,,106038,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cz31jn9wSDkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,100,GoogleBooks

Presented here with original illustrations and bookplates of paintings, drawings, and pictures concerning the myths, this book is a classic addition to any library. LEWIS SPENCE (1874-1955) was a Scottish journalist who recorded Scottish folklore, myths and legends from around the world, histories and legends about the lost world of Atlantis, and works on the occult. Spence graduated from Edinburgh University and was the editor of three magazines, The Scotsman, The Edinburgh Magazine, and The British Weekly.

The Myths of Mexico and Peru,The Myths of Mexico and Peru,Lewis Spence,Lewis Spence,1920,2020-01-08,,"1657482812, 9781657482814",365,244,,"Writers in the sphere of Mexican and Peruvian myth have been few. The first to attack the subject in the light of the modern science of comparative religion was Daniel Garrison Brinton, professor of American languages and archaeology in the University of Philadelphia. He has been followed by Payne, Schellhas, Seler, and Rrstemann, all of whom, however, have confined the publication of their researches to isolated articles in various geographical and scientific journals. The remarks of mythologists who are not also Americanists upon the subject of American myth must be accepted with caution. The question of the alphabets of ancient America is perhaps the most acute in present-day pre-Columbian archaeology. But progress is being made in this branch of the subject, and several scholars are working in whole-hearted co-operation to secure final results. What has Great Britain accomplished in this new and fascinating field of science? If the lifelong and valuable labours of the late Sir Clements Markham be excepted, almost nothing. It is earnestly hoped that the publication of this volume may prove the means of leading many English students to the study and consideration of American archaeology. There remains the romance of old America. The real interest of American mediaeval history must ever circle around Mexico and Peru, her golden empires, her sole exemplars of civilisation; and it is to the books upon the character of these two nations that we must turn for a romantic interest as curious and as absorbing as that bound up in the history of Egypt or Assyria. If human interest is craved for by any man, let him turn to the narratives of Garcilasso el Inca de la Vega and Ixtlilxochitl, representatives and last descendants of the Peruvian and Tezcucan monarchies, and read there the frightful story of the path to fortune of red-heeled Pizarro and cruel Cortés, of the horrible cruelties committed upon the red man, whose colour was ""that of the devil,"" of the awful pageant of fold-sated pirates laden with the treasures of palaces, of the stripping of temples whose very bricks were of gold, whose very drain-pipes were of silver, of rapine and the sacrilege of high places, of porphyry gods dashed down the pyramidal sides of lofty teocallis, of princesses tom from the very steps of the throne-ay, read these for the most wondrous tales ever writ by the hand of man, tales by the side of which the fables of Araby seem dim -the story of a clash of worlds, the conquest of a new, of an isolated hemisphere. It is usual to speak of America as ""a continent without a history."" The folly of such a statement is extreme. For centuries prior to European occupation Central America was the seat of civilisations boasting a history and a semi-historical mythology second to none in richness and interest. It is only because the sources of that history are unknown to the general reader that such assurance upon the lack of it exists. Let us hope that this book may assist in attracting many to the head-fountain of a river whose affluents water many a plain of beauty not the less lovely because bizarre, not the less fascinating because somewhat remote from modern thought. In conclusion I have to acknowledge the courtesy of the Bureau of American Ethnology, which placed in my hands a valuable collection of illustrations and allowed me to select from these at my discretion. The pictures chosen include the drawings used as tailpieces to chapters; others, usually half-tones, are duly acknowledged where they occur.",George G. Harrap& Co.

Its wondrous tales range from the oft-told deeds of Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table to the less-familiar adventures of the mighty Finn and his Fenians, Ulster's Champions of the Red Branch, and other figures from the Gaelic pantheon. Tracing the exploits of kings and saints back to their earliest origins, the author reveals the pagan roots beneath the medieval Christianity and follows the stories' transformations into the fairy tales of the Victorian age.

Guy Standing's immensely influential 2011 book introduced the Precariat as an emerging mass class, characterized by inequality and insecurity. Standing outlined the increasingly global nature of the Precariat as a social phenomenon, especially in the light of the social unrest characterized by the Occupy movements. He outlined the political risks they might pose, and at what might be done to diminish inequality and allow such workers to find a more stable labour identity. His concept and his conclusions have been widely taken up by thinkers from Noam Chomsky to Zygmunt Bauman, by political activists and by policy-makers. This new book takes the debate a stage further, looking in more detail at the kind of progressive politics that might form the vision of a Good Society in which such inequality, and the instability it produces, is reduced. A Precariat Charter discusses how rights - political, civil, social and economic - have been denied to the Precariat, and argues for the importance of redefining our social contract around notions of associational freedom, agency and the commons.",Bloomsbury Academic,A&C Black,politics,Political Science,,106581,,lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zr5nAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,100,GoogleBooks

The delivery driver who brings your packages, the uber driver who gets you to work, the security guard at the mall, the carer looking after our elderly...these are The Precariat. Guy Standing investigates this new and growing group, finding a frustrated and angry new underclass who are often ignored by politicians and economists. The rise of zero hours contracts, encouraged by fat cat corporations as risk-free employment, and by silicon valley as a way of outsourcing costs and responsibility, has been exacerbated by the COVID pandemic. At the same time, in its experience of lockdown, the western world is realizing the true value of these nurses, carers and key workers. The answer? The return of income security and meaningful work - the principles 20th century capitalism was built on. By making the fears and desires of the Precariat central to economic thinking, Standing shows how concepts like Basic Income are not just desirable but inevitable, and plots the way to a better future.",Bloomsbury Academic,Bloomsbury Publishing,politics,Political Science,,106582,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Q8Y4EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,100,GoogleBooks

Ngaire Thomas grew up, married and raised her children within the Exclusive Brethren church in the Palmerston North area. In plain, non-judgemental style, Ngaire describes life inside this community with its strict rules. She says: 'By the time I was nine, I had developed an independent spirit . . . [which] usually meant that a person had begun to think for themselves rather than obeying the M.O.G. [Man of God] - an undesirable trait that needed to be dealt with.' Behind Closed Doors tells of the struggles Ngaire and her family went through in order to remain within this close but challenging community. She and her husband Denis, a very devout man, had a strong and committed marriage, raised five children and attempted to live a good life within the church. However they were eventually excommunicated and went to live 'on the outside'. Ngaire describes the trauma of adjusting to life on the outside and its devastating effects on her children.

There was a village a mile away, and a horse doctor lived there, but there was no surgeon. It seemed a bad outlook; mine was distinctly a surgery case. Then it was remembered that a lady from Boston was summering in that village, and she was a Christian Science doctor and could cure anything. So she was sent for. It was night by this time, and she could not conveniently come, but sent word that it was no matter, there was no hurry, she would give me ""absent treatment"" now, and come in the morning; meantime she begged me to make myself tranquil and comfor-table and remember that there was nothing the matter with me.

An ambitious history of the changing symbolism of the Mother of God, Alone of All Her Sex holds up to the light different emphases occurring at different times, and highlights that the apparent archetype of a magna mater is constantly in play with social and historical conditions and values. Marina Warner's interesting perspective was forged in the aftermath of significant postwar developments in history, anthropology, and feminism and the book inspired fierce debates when it was first published in 1976. Alone of All Her Sex is also an emotive, personal statement, arising from Warner's own upbringing as a Catholic. It picks up on classic accounts such as Mary MacCarthy's Memoirs of a Catholic Girlhood and Antonia White's Frost in May, as well as the author's own experiences at a Catholic boarding school. Highly controversial in conservative quarters, the book's arguments were welcomed and recognised by many readers who shared Warner's experiences. In this new edition, Marina Warner has written a new preface which reviews the book in the light of the current debate about secularism, faith, nations, and social identities. She takes issue with her original mistaken conclusion that the modern age would see the cult of Mary fade away and revises it in the light of recent popes' enthusiasm for the Mother of God, a fresh wave of visions and revelations, a new generation of female saints, and the reorientation of theological approaches to the woman question.",,OUP Oxford,,Literary Criticism,,106460,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TVVoAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,100,GoogleBooks

W. Leibniz gives a clear picture of his philosophical development within the general scheme of seventeenth-century natural philosophy. Catherine Wilson examines the shifts in Leibniz's thinking as he confronted the major philosophical problems of his era. Beginning with his interest in artificial languages and calculi for proof and discovery, the author proceeds to an examination of Leibniz’s early theories of matter and motion, to the phenomenalistic turn in his theory of substance and his subsequent de-emphasis of logical determinism, and finally to his doctrines of harmony and optimization. Specific attention is given to Leibniz’s understanding of Descartes and his successors, Malebranche and Spinoza, and the English philosophers Newton, Cudworth, and Locke. Wilson analyzes Leibniz’s complex response to the new mechanical philosophy, his discontent with the foundations on which it rested, and his return to the past to locate the resources for reconstructing it. She argues that the continuum-problem is the key to an understanding not only of Leibniz’s monadology but also of his views on the substantiality of the self and the impossibility of external causal influence. A final chapter considers the problem of Leibniz-reception in the post-Kantian era, and the difficulty of coming to terms with a metaphysics that is not only philosophically ""critical"" but, at the same time, “compensatory.” Originally published in 1990.

Proctor invites readers into a captivating exploration of scientific ideas through a lens of accessibility and wonder. Proctor employs an engaging literary style, peppered with anecdotal narratives and vivid imagery, which makes complex scientific concepts approachable for a lay audience. Set against the backdrop of the late 19th century, a period marked by rapid advancements in science and technology, Proctor's work reflects the burgeoning enthusiasm for scientific inquiry that characterized the era, emphasizing how science can enhance everyday life and foster a sense of appreciation for nature and the universe. Richard A. Proctor (1837-1888) was an esteemed British astronomer and science writer known for his popularization of astronomy and his fervent advocacy for public engagement with science. Proctor's background as a lecturer and writer, coupled with his own experiences in the field, compelled him to articulate the wonders of science in an enjoyable and enlightening manner. His commitment to demystifying science stemmed from a desire to inspire curiosity and a deeper understanding of the world among everyday readers. ""Pleasant Ways in Science"" is a must-read for those who seek to rekindle their sense of childlike wonder about the natural world. Proctor's ability to weave scientific facts with relatable narratives will not only broaden your understanding of various scientific topics but also inspire a lifelong passion for discovery. Whether you are a student, educator, or simply a curious mind, this book promises to enrich your appreciation for the sciences.",Longmans Green,Good Press,Science,Science,Hardback,102785,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ihnEDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,98.53,GoogleBooks

Robinson,2000,1975,,UCAL:B4411063,328,312,,"“Renascent Rationalism represents a new and provocative departure from the mostly barren currents of twentieth-century philosophy. The author, enlisting the aid of theoretical science, leads off from the tradition of Plato, Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, and Russell and then steps well beyond. The result is a single, integrated philosophical system resting in direct opposition to the contemporary positions of analysis, empiricism, pragmatism, existentialism, and phenomenology.There are four major effects of Helier Robinson’s acceptance of the Leibniz-Russell theory of perception as his base: all the philosophic problems of perception are solved; a whole new philosophy of science develops; an entirely new theory of mind emerges; and some startling theological and ethical consequences ensue. The art of metaphysical speculation is thus revived.Renascent Rationalism offers a clear, if controversial, alternative to the dominating influence of Hume and Kant and the resulting blind alleys of much modern philosophizing.”- Publisher",Speedside Publishing,Macmillan of Canada : Maclean-Hunter Press,Philosophy,Mind and body,Paperback,102443,21,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-vaeAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,98.53,GoogleBooks

The Expressions of the Emotions in Man and Animals,The Expression of The Emotions in Man and Animals,Charles Darwin,Charles Darwin,1948,2025-01-16,,,179,9,,"The Expression of The Emotions in Man and Animals by Charles Darwin offers groundbreaking insights into the link between emotions and human behavior, proposing that emotional expressions are not solely a human phenomenon but are shared with animals as part of the evolutionary process. First published in 1872, this work explores how emotions manifest through facial expressions, body language, and vocalizations, asserting that these expressions are universal across species and are evolutionary traits inherited over time. Darwin begins by examining how emotions such as joy, anger, fear, and surprise are expressed through specific physical movements, gestures, and facial expressions. His detailed observations argue that these emotional expressions are not learned behaviors, but rather, are instinctive responses that have evolved for survival purposes. He connects emotional expressions to evolutionary advantages, such as signaling danger or forming social bonds, which were essential for the survival of early humans and animals. In addition to humans, Darwin closely studies the emotional behaviors of various animals, highlighting how similar patterns emerge in both human and animal behavior. He suggests that these expressions were inherited through evolutionary descent from a common ancestor, further reinforcing his theory of evolution by natural selection. Through this comprehensive study, Darwin not only deepens our understanding of human psychology and emotional expression but also emphasizes the continuity of life across species. His analysis of the facial muscles involved in expression, along with his observations of the emotional responses of different species, presents a compelling argument for the biological basis of emotion. This classic work remains influential in both psychology and evolutionary biology, serving as a precursor to modern research in emotional intelligence and nonverbal communication. By connecting emotions to evolution, Darwin changed the way we perceive human behavior, offering a more holistic understanding of emotional expression. Why Read This Book? The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals is essential for anyone interested in psychology, evolutionary biology, or the science of human behavior. Darwin's insights into the biological roots of emotion continue to shape modern studies in human expression, body language, and communication. Readers interested in understanding the universality of human emotions and their evolutionary origins will find this book an invaluable resource. Whether you’re a student of psychology, biology, or philosophy, Darwin’s work invites a deeper exploration into the way emotions connect us to the animal kingdom, urging us to reconsider the complexity of our shared nature. This book is an essential read for those seeking a deeper understanding of the scientific basis of emotions and how they influence behavior.",Watts & Co.,Namaskar Books,Biology,Science,Hardback,101007,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=D9w-EQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,98.5,GoogleBooks

For the earlier upholders of the theory I am indebted to Dr. Whewell, who, in his Dialogue on the Plurality of Worlds-a Supplement to his well-known volume on the subject-refers to all writers of importance known to him. The earliest are the great astronomers Kepler and Huygens, and the learned Bishop Wilkins, who all believed that the moon was or might probably be inhabited; and of these Whewell considers Wilkins to have been by far the most thoughtful and earnest in supporting his views.

Forced into our awareness 4000 years ago by the need to count ever larger multitudes, zero drifted in and out of focus, disappeared for centuries, then swept from the East into the medieval world, with fears and superstitions crouched around it. Did we discover or invent it? Was it the devil's work? Is it a number or a fiction? Its users came to see that it held immense power to unriddle the universe, leading to profound insights into the mind and the world.

Religion: Its functions in Human Life,"Religion, Its Functions in Human Life",Knight Dunlap,Knight Dunlap,1946,1946,,UOM:39015001431959,,380,,"It is the purpose of this book to present religion as a normal product of man's conscious processes: his desires, his fears, and especially his planning for future contingencies. In order to understand the role a religion may or may not play in the civilization of the future, it is necessary to understand the roles that the religions of the past, from which religions of the present day have developed, have played in the cultures of which they were integral parts. Only through the study of these roles is it possible to discover what religion really is. This historical or genetic method is only one part of the full comparative method that is essential for a complete study of religion. The other part of the comparative method is the comparison of religions that exist contemporaneously and which have little, if any, genetic relation to one another. The religions of civilized peoples can be understood by tracing them back to their foundations in religions of ancient cultures from which our civilization developed. This genetic method at least gives a primary understanding of the nature and functions of religion, which suffices for the purpose of this volume; the religions of civilized peoples having borrowed little from either the religions of present-day savages or those of semicivilized peoples, the full comparative method is not essential for our purposes. That the psychological problems of religion are primarily problems for group psychology and that the problems of personal religion are secondary in importance should be evident from the principle that is now generally accepted by scholars in the field of the history of religion. This principle, which is explained and illustrated in the text, is that faith develops from ritual, rather than ritual from faith.",,,Religion,"Psychology, Religious",,106247,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8-0bAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,97.97,GoogleBooks

Terror and violence became their unmistakable hallmark. Each of these secret groups is looked at separately, enabling direct comparisons to be made between them. Uniting them all was a common philosophy of extreme violence and murder. There have been few periods in history, few civilizations or regions of the world that have not seen the rise of some obscure and close-knit cult. This book focuses primarily on the ancient and medieval worlds, and illustrates how the fanatical cult members often mirrored the world they inhabited, and how the establishment reacted to - and eventually destroyed - these organizations. Wherever and whenever they flourished, these warrior cults had their own strict codes and rituals, and today they provide a fascinating and disturbing insight into the perennial desire to unite for a single purpose. When combined with murderous and bloodthirsty compulsions, these groups become feared and reviled. In the modern world, with its equivalent proliferation of religious, political and criminal sects and organizations, Warrior Cults is a timely and intriguing source of reference and comparison.",,Blandford Press,,Social Science,,106233,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DKGHQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,97.73,GoogleBooks

It appears, beyond any doubt, that the Roman Catholic institution is not a Christian church and never was. The poor Roman Catholic people have been betrayed by her and are facing spiritual disaster. Paris shows that Rome is responsible for the two great world wars. Author Edmond Paris explains why he wrote this book... ""The public is practically unaware of the overwhelming responsibility carried by the Vatican and its Jesuits in the start of the two world wars -- a situation which may be explained in part by the gigantic finances at the disposition of the Vatican and its Jesuits, giving them power in so many spheres, especially since the last conflict."" ""In fact, the part they took in those tragic events has hardly been mentioned until the present time, except by apologists eager to disguise it.

Wells, a socialist and prominent political thinker as well as a first-rate novelist, set down in The Rights of Man a stirring manifesto, designed to instruct the international community on how best to safeguard human rights. The work gained traction, and was soon under discussion for becoming actual legislation. Although Wells didn’t live to see it enacted, his words laid the groundwork for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which enshrined human rights in law for the first time, and was adopted by the United Nations in 1948, changing the course of history for ever and granting fundamental rights to billions.

G. Wells' ""First and Last Things: A Confession of Faith and Rule of Life"" presents a contemplative exploration of existentialism, spirituality, and the pursuit of truth. Written in a confessional style, the book blends philosophical inquiry with personal reflection, examining not only the nature of belief but also the ethical implications of living a life guided by such beliefs. It resonates with the intellectual currents of the early 20th century, when questions of science, religion, and human purpose were being fervently debated. Wells juxtaposes human instinct against rational thought, urging a synthesis of these opposing forces in constructing a meaningful existence. Wells, a pioneer of science fiction and an outspoken critic of social injustices, was profoundly influenced by the tumultuous events of his era, including the industrial revolution and world wars. His diverse interests in sociology, politics, and science deeply inform his philosophical outlook, resulting in a work that challenges the reader to confront personal and collective responsibilities in light of a rapidly changing world. Through his exploration of faith and reason, Wells seeks to cultivate a deeper understanding of mankind's place in the universe. This thought-provoking text is a must-read for those interested in the intersection of philosophy, spirituality, and social critique.

Olga Chekhova was a stunning Russian beauty and a famous Nazi-era film actress who Hitler counted among his friends; she was also the niece of Anton Chekhov. After fleeing Bolshevik Moscow for Berlin in 1920, she was recruited by her composer brother Lev, to work for Soviet intelligence. In return, her family were allowed to join her. The extraordinary story of how the whole family survived the Russian Revolution, the civil war, the rise of Hitler, the Stalinist Terror, and the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union becomes, in Antony Beevor's hands, a breathtaking tale of compromise and survival in a merciless age.",,Penguin UK,History/ World War II,Biography & Autobiography,,100167,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=B_KN0iGvVXsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,97.22,GoogleBooks

It features Easton and Guddat's own highly regarded translations (based on the best German editions as well as on the original manuscripts and first editions) and reveals differences as well as continuities between the ""young"" and the ""old"" Marx.

On its first publication in 1972 it created an international debate and became a rallying-point for feminism, changing the terminology of anthropologists forever. Starting with her demolition of the Biblical myth that woman was an afterthought to the creation of man, Elaine Morgan rewrites human history and evolution. This lively, informative book sets out to solve the riddle of our origins; its answer is controversial. Elaine Morgan has made the 'Aquatic Ape Hypothesis' a plausible alternative to conventional theories of evolution and 'The Descent of Woman' first set out an understanding of who humans are and where they come from.",,Mitchell Beazley,Women / Politics,Fiction,,104319,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t_MGXeS73woC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,96.25,GoogleBooks

Ray (Edwin Ray) Lankester I am writing in early September from Interlaken, one of the loveliest spots in Europe when blessed with a full blaze of sunlight and only a few high-floating clouds, but absolutely detestable in dull, rainy weather, losing its beauty as the fairy scenes of a theatre do when viewed by dreary daylight. It is the case of the little girl of whom it is recorded that ""When she was good she was very good, and when she was not she was horrid."" This morning, after four days' misconduct, Interlaken was very good. The tremendous sun-blaze seemed to fill the valleys with a pale blue luminous vapour, cut sharply by the shadows of steep hill-sides. Here and there the smoke of some burning weeds showed up as brightest blue. Far away through the gap formed in the long range of nearer mountains, where the Lütschine Valley opens into the vale of Interlaken, the Jungfrau appeared in full majesty, absolutely brilliant and unearthly. So I walked towards her up the valley. Zweilütschinen is the name given to the spot where the valley divides into two, that to the left leading up to Grindelwald, under the shadow of the Mönch and the Wetterhorn, that to the right bringing one to Lauterbrünnen and the Staubbach waterfall, with the snow-fields of the Tchingel finally closing the way-over which I climbed years ago to Ried in the Loetschen Thal. We are delighted to publish this classic book as part of our extensive Classic Library collection. Many of the books in our collection have been out of print for decades, and therefore have not been accessible to the general public. The aim of our publishing program is to facilitate rapid access to this vast reservoir of literature, and our view is that this is a significant literary work, which deserves to be brought back into print after many decades. The contents of the vast majority of titles in the Classic Library have been scanned from the original works.

He played an important role in encouraging interest in the study of social and economic history of the Middle Ages among younger scholars. These ten essays, all on aspects of religion, were somewhat controversial in their day. Coulton believed that sectarian bias frequently caused a distorted view of history, and he was highly critical of Roman Catholic interpretations of the medieval church. In the appendices he gives a detailed critique of Cardinal Francis Gasquet's historical writings, listing what Coulton regards as errors or deliberate falsifications.

But Koresh was neither the first, nor the most excessive, nor even the most misguided, and Colin Wilson looks at cult leaders from the early days of Christianity through, among others, the 'Rev' Jim Jones and Jeffrey Lundgren. He goes on to consider what it is that makes these messiahs believe they are who they claim to be, and what makes people give up everything to follow them - a messiah is nothing without someone to believe in him. This comprehensive study untangles the history of the charlatan messiahs and explores their world view. Colin Wilson's remarkable career has led him to write on subjects as diverse as archaeology, astronomy, cosmology, Egyptology, crime and the paranormal.

His name was John Law and he had a good reason to go, having killed a man in a duel. Living off his lucrative winnings at the gaming tables of Europe, Law became increasingly fascinated by the nature of finance and journeyed to the impoverished , famine-stricken France of Louis XIV with an extraordinary idea. At the time when wealth was stored and exchanged as gold and silver coin - and there was rarely enough to fund the extravagance of kings, let alone trade - Law realised that the overriding problem was lack of available money. He reasoned that if this could be lent in the form of paper, properly backed by assets, then it could be lend repeatedly and credit used to multiply the opportunities for the making of money. Such a radical notion meant Law faced opposition from powerful vested interests. His persistence paid off in 1716 when, with royal backing, he established the first French bank to issue paper money. He also created a trading company which made its shareholders rich beyond their wildest dreams: so much so that the new term 'millionaire' was coined to describe them. What follows is the stuff of epic drama: a tale of fortunes won and lost, of paupers made rich and lords losing all. And in telling this enthralling tragi-comic story, Janet Gleeson brings to life two fascinating characters who together would change the way the world worked: the inscrutable John Law, and mercurial money itself.",,Random House,,Biography & Autobiography,,101357,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=98XQIEcbnagC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,95,GoogleBooks

Julian Huxley’s The Individual in the Animal Kingdom, published in 1912, is a concise and groundbreaking work that is almost entirely unknown today. In it, Huxley analyzes the evolutionary advances in life’s organizational complexity, anticipating many of today’s ideas about changes in individuality. Huxley’s overarching system of concepts and his coherent logical principles were so far ahead of their time that they remain valid to this day. In part, this is because his explicitly Darwinian approach carefully distinguished between the integrated form and function of hierarchies within organisms and loosely defined, nonorganismal ecological communities. In The Individual in the Animal Kingdom, we meet a youthful Huxley who uses his commanding knowledge of natural history to develop a nonreductionist account of life’s complexity that aligns with seminal early insights by Darwin, Wallace, Weismann, and Wheeler. As volume editors Richard Gawne and Jacobus Boomsma point out, this work disappeared into oblivion despite its relevance for contemporary research on organismal complexity and major evolutionary transitions.

One of the most controversial figures on the intellectual scene, Ayn Rand was the proponent of a moral philosophy—and ethic of rational self-interest—that stands in sharp opposition to the ethics of altruism and self-sacrifice.

Most came from humble families, all lived far from the centre of things, but they were young and their optimism was boundless: together they would change the world. Among them were the ambitious toy-maker Matthew Boulton and his partner James Watt, of steam-engine fame; the potter Josiah Wedgwood; the larger-than-life Erasmus Darwin, physician, poet, inventor and theorist of evolution (a forerunner of his grandson Charles Darwin). Later came Joseph Priestley, discoverer of oxygen and fighting radical. Led by Erasmus Darwin they joined a small band of allies, formed the Lunar Society of Birmingham (so called because it met at each full moon) and kick-started the Industrial Revolution. Blending science, art, and commerce, the Lunar Men built canals, launched balloons, named plants, gases and minerals, changed the face of England and the china in its drawing rooms, and plotted to revolutionise its soul. Jenny Uglow's The Lunar Men is a vivid and swarming group portrait that brings to life the friendships, political passions, love affairs, and love of knowledge (and power) that drove these extraordinary men. It echoes the thud of pistons and the wheeze and snort of engines, and brings to life the tradesmen, artisans, and tycoons who shaped and fired the modern age. Winner of the PEN Hessel-Tiltman prize for history, and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for biography, The Lunar Men captures the creation of the modern world with lucid intelligence, sympathy and wisdom.

It does not aim to cover the subject as a textbook would, but aims to delve deeper into some of the characters who were involved with the Church or the Councils during this period. Beginning with Eusebius of Caesarea and the first council of the Church at Nicaea, and ending with Theodoret of Cyrrhus, who is thought to have changed his view of Christology after the watershed Council of Chalcedon, this unique text surveys some of the most influential characters to have shaped Church history and the formation of doctrine. Surveying a mixture of significant literary figures, laymen, bishops and heretics this book presents biographical, literary-critical and theological information about each. They are chosen either because they are important to the history of doctrine, or because new material about them has thrown light upon their work, or because they will broaden the reader's understanding of the culture and history of the period or of live issues in the church at the time. Structured in five parts, each part deals with a period of time and a sequence of characters, so the book is easily followed in chronological order. Added to this, is the double bibliography, which in this edition is fully updated. Bibliography A details those texts in English of the original texts of antiquity, whilst Bibliography B provides details of publications in English, French and German which have appeared since 1960-2004 on or about the characters discussed in the body of the text.",SCM Press,SCM Press,Literature,Religion,,106331,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GWSmDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,94.23,GoogleBooks

The only remedy was the appointment of a stranger. Murmurs were heard that no one could canonically be elected Pope, who had not been ordained Deacon and Priest in the Church of Rome. The insulting language of the Germans was, that in the whole Church there was scarcely one who was not disqualified either as illiterate, or as tainted with simony, or as living in notorious concubinage. Suidger, the Bishop of Bamberg, was consecrated Pope at Sutri; the first Pope consecrated out of Rome. On the arrival of the Emperor at Rome, the usual appeal was made to the Roman people whether they knew one worthier to be Pope. The German soldiers stood around; the people preserved an obsequious silence. The Bishop of Bamberg was led by Henry himself to the papal throne; the people seemed to assent by their acclamations.

For now the alternative of an Italian had been abandoned; a Roman, none but a Roman, would content the people. The madness of intoxication was added to the madness of popular fury. The rabble had broken open the Pope's cellar, and drunk his rich wines.g In the Conclave the wildest projects were started. The Cardinal Orsini's was to dress 11p a Minorite Friar (pro bably a Spiritual) in the Papal robes, to show him to the people, and so for themselves to effect their escape to some safe place, and proceed to a legitimate election.

Their usefulness, I conceive, might have been increased by more systematic annotation from economic literature; but other pressing occupations make that impossible. Since, further, they make no pretension to constitute a systematic economic treatise, but aim only at a partial practical application of economic ideas to the great problem of ""reconstruction,"" a larger array of authorities might suggest a much higher estimate of their lasting utility than I put upon them. If they are at any point much outside of economic ""orthodoxy,"" it is in their treatment of the scientific conception of Capital.

It is or may be conducive to total comprehension, to coherence of judgment, and in a measure even to the understanding of details. A distinguished expert in historical and philological research has avowed that specialists sometimes get their most illuminating ideas from a haphazard glance into a popular and condensed presentment of their own subject. Without hoping so to help the experts, I humbly conceive that the present conspectus of Christian history may do an occasional service even to an opponent by bringing out a clear issue. Writers of a different way of thinking have done as much for me. The primary difficulty is of course the problem of origins. In my treatment of this problem, going as I do beyond the concessions of the most advanced professional scholars, I cannot expect much acquiescence for the present. It must here suffice to say, first, that the data and the argument, insofar as they are not fully set forth in the following pages, have been presented in the larger work entitled Christianity and Mythology,1 or in the quarters mentioned in the Synopsis of Literature appended to this volume; and, secondly, to urge that opponents should read the study on the Gospels by Professor Schmiedel in the new Encyclopædia Biblica before taking up their defensive positions...",Watts & Co,anboco,Christianity / History,Religion,,102998,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6wyvEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,93.75,GoogleBooks

Mr. Kaufman's valuable study does not offer a doctrine of God, but instead explores why God is a problem for many moderns, the dimensions of that problem, and the inner logic of the notion of God as it has developed in Western culture. His object is to determine the function or significance of talk about God: how the concept of God is generated in human experience; the special problems in turn generated by this concept (for example, the intelligibility of the idea of transcendence, the problem of theodicy) and how they are met; and under what circumstances the idea of God is credible or important or even indispensable. He does not try to prove God's existence or nonexistence, but elucidates what the concept of God means and the important human needs it fulfills.

Now ten years on, research has itself moved forward, and Rose has taken the opportunity to fully revise the book. But this is more than mere revision. Where ten years ago he argued the case for research on memory because it is the most extraordinary of human attributes, Rose's own research has now opened the doors to a potential new treatment for Alzheimer's Disease undreamed of a decade ago, and in an entirely new chapter he describes how this potential breakthrough has occurred.",,Random House,Science,Psychology,,103470,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2M9pm0-0qxYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,93.18,GoogleBooks

Swenson and Walter Lowrie,"Contents include: Foreword Editor's Preface Introduction by the Editor Preface Introduction BOOK ONE: The Objective Problem Concerning the Truth of Christianity Introductory Remarks Chapter I: The Historical Point of View 1. The Holy Scriptures 2. The Church 3. The Proof of the Centuries for the Truth of Christianity Chapter II: The Speculative Point of View BOOK TWO: The Subjective Problem, The Relation of the Subject to the Truth of Christianity, The Problem of Becoming a Christian PART ONE: Something About Lessing Chapter I: An Expression of Gratitude Chapter II: Theses Possibly or Actually Attributable to Lessing 1. The subjective existing thinker has regard to the dialectics of the process of communication 2. The existing subjective thinker is in his existential relation to the truth as negative as he is positive; he has a much humor as he has essential pathos; and he is constantly in process of becoming, i.e. he is always striving 3. Lessing has said that accidental historical truths can never serve as proofs for eternal truths of the reason; and that the transition by which it is proposed to base an eternal truth upon historical testimony is a leap 4. Lessing has said that, if God held all truth in His right hand, and in His left the lifelong pursuit of it, he would choose the left hand A. A logical system is possible B. An existential system is possible PART TWO: How the Subjectivity of the Individual Must be Qualified in Order that the Problem May Exist for Him Chapter I: The Task of Becoming Subjective. The conclusion that would be forced upon ethics if the attainment of subjectivity were not the highest task confronting a human being—Considerations left out of account in connection with the closer understanding of this—Examples of thinking directed towards becoming subjective Chapter II: The Subjective Truth, Inwardness; Truth is Subjectivity Appendix. A Glance at the Contemporary Effort in Danish Literature Chapter III: Real or Ethical Subjectivity—The Subjective Thinker 1. Existence and Reality 2. Possibility as higher than Reality—Reality as higher than Possibility—Poetic and Intellectual Ideality—Ethical Ideality 3. The Simultaneity of the Individual Factors of Subjectivity in the Existing Subject—The Constrast between this Simultaneity and the Speculative Process 4. The Subjective Thinker—his Task, his Form, his Style Chapter IV: The Problem of the Fragments: How can an Eternal Happiness be based upon Historical Knowledge? Section I. For Orientation in the Plan of the Fragments 1. That the point of departure was taken in the pagan consciousness, and why 2. The importance of a preliminary agreement concerning what Christianity is, before there can be any question of mediating between Christianity and speculative thought. The absence of such an agreement favors the proposal of medication, while at the same time making any mediation illusory; the presence of such an agreement precludes mediation 3. The problem of the Fragments viewed as a problem, introductory not to Christianity, but to becoming a Christian Section II. The Problem Itself. The eternal happiness of the individual is decided in time through the relationship to something historical, which is furthermore of such a character as to oinclude in its composition that which by virtue of its essence cannot become historical, and must therefore become such by virtue of the absurd A. Existential Pathos 1. The Initial Expression for Existential Pathos: the absolute direction (respect) toward the absolute telos, expressed in action through the transformation of the individual's existence Aesthetic Pathos—The deceptiveness of the principle of mediation—The medieval monastic movement—The simultaneous maintenance of an absolute relationship to the absolute telos and a relative relationship to the relative ends 2. The Essential Expression for Existential pathos: Suffering—Fortune and misforutne as the expression for an aesthetic view of life, in constradistinction to suffering as the expression of a religious view (illustrated by reference to the religious discourse)—The Reality of suffering (humor)—The reality of suffering in the last instance as evidence for the possession by the existing individual of a relationship to an eternal happiness—The illusion of religiosity—The category of Anfechtung—The primary ground and significance of the religious suffering: The dying away from the life of immediacy while still remaining in the finite—An edifying divertisement—Humor as an incognito for religiosity 3. The Decisive Expression for existential pathos: Guilt—That the investigation goes backward instead of forward—The eternal recollection of guilt is the highest expression for the relation between the consciousness of guilt and an eternal happiness—Lower expressions for the consciousness of guilt, and corresponding forms of satisfaction—Self-imposted penance—Humor—The religiosity of hidden inwardness Intermediate Clause between A and B B. The Dilectical 1. The dialectical contradiction which constitutes the breach: to expect an eternal happiness in time through a relationship to something else in time 2. The dialectical constradiction that an eternal happiness is based upon something historical 3. The dialectical contradiction that the historical fact here in question is not a simple historical fact, but is constituted by that which only against its nature can become historical, hence by virtue of the absurd Appendix to B. The retroactive effect of the dialectical upon the pathetic, and the factor simultaneously present in the pathos (a) The consciousness of sin (b) The possibililty of offense (c) The smart of sympathy Chapter V.

Ambedkar is an incisive and seminal work that examines one of the most enduring social institutions in Indian society-caste. It provides a comprehensive analysis of the caste system, its historical origins, and its profound impact on Indian society. Ambedkar delves into the complex structure of caste, dissecting its divisions, hierarchies, and oppressive practices that have shaped the lives of millions for centuries. He presents a comprehensive critique of the caste system and offers a vision for its eradication and emancipation. He passionately argues for social justice, equality, and the importance of individual rights, challenging the entrenched notions of superiority and discrimination perpetuated by the caste system. Ambedkar's groundbreaking work remains a cornerstone in the discourse on caste and social reform in India, and his profound insights and unwavering commitment to social reform make this book an essential read for anyone seeking to understand the complexities of caste and its impact on Indian society.",Gov't of Maharashtra,,India,,,101054,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cb0Y0AEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,92.31,GoogleBooks

The God part of the Brain,"The ""God"" Part of the Brain",Mathew Alper,Matthew Alper,2006,2008-09-01,,"9781402236372, 1402236379",,290,,"A thought-provoking study of science and religion about our human need to believe in a higher power, for spiritual seekers and atheists alike. In The God Part of the Brain, Matthew Alper pioneers a radical theory: the human inclination toward spirituality and belief in a higher power can be attributed to a specific part of our brain. This bold hypothesis takes us on an exciting journey that merges science, philosophy, and spirituality in a unique way. Alper engages readers with compelling arguments based on neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and anthropology, provoking profound thought on the nature of existence and our inherent need for spiritual meaning as a coping mechanism that emerged in humans to help us survive our unique and otherwise debilitating awareness of death. His narrative is accessible yet deeply profound, providing insights that stimulate both intellectual curiosity and spiritual introspection. Key Features: Groundbreaking Hypothesis: Presents a bold new theory about the neuroscientific basis of human spirituality. Interdisciplinary Approach: Combines insights from neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and anthropology to explore spiritual experiences. Intellectually Stimulating: Challenges readers to contemplate profound questions about existence, faith, and the human mind. Accessible Narrative: Engages readers with a narrative that is both informative and accessible, regardless of their scientific background. Provocative and Thoughtful: Invites deep introspection about our inherent need for spiritual meaning. Praise for The ""God"" Part of the Brain ""This cult classic in many ways parallels Rene Descartes' search for reliable and certain knowledge...Drawing on such disciplines as philosophy, psychology, and biology, Alper argues that belief in a spiritual realm is an evolutionary coping method that developed to help humankind deal with the fear of death...Highly recommended.""— Library Journal ""I very much enjoyed the account of your spiritual journey and believe it would make excellent reading for every college student - the resultant residence-hall debates would be the best part of their education. It often occurs to me that if, against all odds, there is a judgmental God and heaven, it will come to pass that when the pearly gates open, those who had the valor to think for themselves will be escorted to the head of the line, garlanded, and given their own personal audience."" — Edward O. Wilson, two-time Pulitzer Prize-Winner ""This is an essential book for those in search of a scientific understanding of man's spiritual nature. Matthew Alper navigates the reader through a labyrinth of intriguing questions and then offers undoubtedly clear answers that lead to a better understanding of our objective reality."" — Elena Rusyn, MD, PhD; Gray Laboratory; Harvard Medical School ""What a wonderful book you have written. It was not only brilliant and provocative but also revolutionary in its approach to spirituality as an inherited trait.""— Arnold Sadwin, MD, former chief of Neuropsychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania ""A lively manifesto...For the discipline's specific application to the matter at hand, I've seen nothing that matches the fury of The 'God' Part of the Brain, which perhaps explains why it's earned something of a cult following."" — Salon.com ""All 6 billion plus inhabitants of Earth should be in possession of this book. Alper's tome should be placed in the sacred writings' section of libraries, bookstores, and dwellings throughout the world. Matthew Alper is the new Galileo...Immensely important...Defines in a clear and concise manner what each of us already knew but were afraid to admit and exclaim.""— John Scoggins, PhD ""Vibrant ... vivacious.

A first-rate philosopher in his own right, Kaufmann here provides the fullest account of his views on religion. Although he considered himself a heretic, he was not immune to the wellsprings and impulses from which religion originates, declaring it among the most vital and radical expressions of the human mind. Beginning with an autobiographical prologue that traces his evolution from religious believer to ""heretic,"" the book touches on theology, organized religion, morality, suffering, and death—all examined from the perspective of a ""quest for honesty."" Kaufmann also subjects philosophy's faith in truth, reason, and absolute morality to the same heretical treatment. The resulting exploration of the faiths of a nonbeliever in a secular age is as fresh and challenging as when it was first published. In a new foreword, Stanley Corngold vividly describes the intellectual and biographical milieu of Kaufmann’s provocative book.",Anchor,Princeton University Press,Theology / Philosophy,Philosophy,,104850,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JFGUBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,91.67,GoogleBooks

The Pattern Paradigm looks beneath the surface of what passes for truth and presents a new way of understanding. It tells the story of how knowledge is achieved; starting from the basics and progressing to the pyramid of patterns which lie at the heart of thinking. It describes how the pattern paradigm is superior to the status quo paradigm that pervades much of philosophy today. It is able to do this because it is a paradigm of great simplicity and great power. It opens up a new and more accurate way of understanding. It provides the missing link between sense-data and knowledge. It provides new insights into old problems which are not only amazing but also robust and self consistent. It is a book for both keen philosophers and for anyone else interested in philosophy, as it is easy to read and written in layman’s terms.

The Agricola and the Germania,The Agricola and The Germania,H. Tacitus.,Tacitus,1948,2019-11-08,,"1420964771, 9781420964776",,90,Translated by H. Mattingly,"""The Agricola"" and ""The Germania"" are two important historical works by Cornelius Tacitus, an ancient Roman Senator and historian who lived from 56 AD to 120 AD. Tacitus lived in what historians call the Silver Age of Latin literature and his contributions to the histories of these tumultuous times are considered significant and illuminating. ""The Agricola"" is a biography of the Roman general Gnaeus Julius Agricola, who was Tacitus's father-in-law. It is also a geographic and ethnographic history of Ancient Britain. Tacitus draws an unfavorable comparison between the liberty enjoyed by the Britons to the corruption and cruelty of Rome and offers a biting and insightful commentary on the Roman greed that justified the oppression and exploitation of the British people. ""The Germania"" is an ethnographic study of the peoples believed by Tacitus to be part of the ancient Germanic tribes, including their laws, lands and customs. While these works are not as well-known as Tacitus' other classics, such as the ""Annals"", or the ""Histories"", ""The Agricola"" and ""The Germania"" remain important first-hand documents of ancient history and people lost to time.

The volume contains nearly 750 letters, two-thirds of which are published for the first time, to 350 correspondents, famous and obscure. The letters include one to Mrs Thomas Hardy on her husband's Abbey funeral, one to the Dean of Westminster on homosexuality and a letter to his wife from Moscow on the Communist experiment.

He established that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors, and proposed the scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection. Darwin published his theory with compelling evidence for evolution in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species, overcoming scientific rejection of earlier concepts of transmutation of species. By the 1870s the scientific community and much of the general public had accepted evolution as a fact. However, many favoured competing explanations and it was not until the emergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in which natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution. In modified form, Darwin's scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the life sciences, explaining thediversity of life. -wikipedia",Watts & Co.,CreateSpace,Biography,Reference,Hardback,104894,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=A_pDMAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,90.32,GoogleBooks

As the object of attack and suspicion by fundamentalists, conservatives, and traditional religionists, Howard B. Radest believes that humanism deserves a clear and responsible treatment. He accomplishes this in this book by clarifying the nature of humanism in historical and current thought. The Enlightenment, Radest states, gave birth to a number of humanist values that are still being worked out in today's societies. He reconstructs how humanist values have been considered dangerous by those who fear a change in the status quo. Humanism, Radest maintains, is the true descendant of the age of reason and freedom. In this unique volume, humanism is viewed as being misunderstood by both traditionalists and the humanists themselves. Radest does not wish to disparage traditional beliefs, but he emphasizes that humanism is a legitimate philosophical, ideological, and religious alternative--a party to the current struggle for a postmodern life philosophy. The Devil and Secular Humanism examines humanism in a more comprehensive way than most current literature, and it includes an assessment of the prospects for humanism in the years ahead. It will be of great use to a literate, but nontechnical, audience who are engaged in philosophy, religion, law, and politics.",Praeger Publishers,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,Humanism,Religion,Hardback,104350,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IOrEEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,90.14,GoogleBooks

In that extremity the proud Freethinker turns to Jesus Christ, renounces his wicked scepticism, implores pardon of the Savior he has despised, and shudders at the awful scenes that await him in the next world should the hour of forgiveness be past. Pictorial art has been pressed into the service of this plea for religion, and in such orthodox periodicals as the British Workman, to say nothing of the horde of pious inventions which are circulated as tracts, expiring sceptics have been portrayed in agonies of terror, gnashing their teeth, wringing their hands, rolling their eyes, and exhibiting every sign of despair. One minister of the gospel, the Rev. Erskine Neale, has not thought it beneath his dignity to compose an extensive series of these holy frauds, under the title of Closing Scenes. This work was, at one time, very popular and influential; but its specious character having been exposed, it has fallen into disrepute, or at least into neglect.

The ordinary reader cannot be expected to possess a complete acquaintance with the career and achievements of every great soldier of progress; and I have therefore considered it prudent to afford such information as might be deemed necessary to a proper appreciation of the character, the greatness, and the renown, of the subjects of my sketches.

Rise of Scientific Philosophy,The Rise of Scientific Philosophy,Hans Reichenbach,Hans Reichenbach,1951,1951,,"0520010558, 9780520010550",,352,,"This book represents a new approach to philosophy. It treats philosophy as not a collection of systems, but as a study of problems. It recognizes in traditional philosophical systems the historical function of having asked questions rather than having given solutions. Professor Reichenbach traces the failures of the systems to psychological causes. Speculative philosophers offered answers at a time when science had not yet provided the means to give true answers. Their search for certainty and for moral directives led them to accept pseudo-solutions. Plato, Descartes, Spinoza, Kant, and many others are cited to illustrate the rationalist fallacy: reason, unaided by observation, was regarded as a source of knowledge, revealing the physical world and ""moral truth."" The empiricists could not disprove this thesis, for they could not give a valid account of mathematical knowledge. Mathematical discoveries in the early nineteenth century cleared the way for modern scientific philosophy. Its advance was furthered by discoveries in modern physics, chemistry, biology, and psychology. These findings have made possible a new conception of the universe and of the atom. The work of scientists thus altered philosophy completely and brought into being a philosopher with a new attitude and training. Instead of dictating so-called laws of reason to the scientist, this modern philosopher proceeds by analyzing scientific methods and results. He finds answers to the age-old questions of space, time, causality, and life; of the human observer and the external world. He tells us how to find our way through this world without resorting to unjustifiable beliefs or assuming a supernatural origin for moral standards. Philosophy thus is no longer a battleground of contradictory opinions, but a science discovering truth step by step. Professor Reichenbach, known for his many contributions to logic and the philosophy of science, addresses this book to a wider audience. He writes for those who do not have the leisure or preparation to read in the fields of mathematics, symbolic logic, or physics. Besides showing the principal foundations of the new philosophy, he has been careful to provide the necessary factual background. He has written a philosophical study, not a mere popularization. It contains within its chapters all the necessary scientific material in an understandable form—and, therefore, conveys all the information indispensable to a modern world-view. The late Hans Reichenbach was Professor of Philosophy at the University of California, Los Angeles.

McKown introduces these major works on religion, and then presents an extensive synopsis of each. He defends Bentham against the criticisms of opponents where necessary, but does not hesitate to criticize Bentham when he feels he goes astray. McKown also shows how Bentham's attacks on the Christianity of his time, which denigrated human life in the here-and-now for some imagined future postmortem state of glory, fully complemented his utilitarian philosophy of the greatest happiness to the greatest number of people.

Robinson,1968,2011-04-28,,"022717349X, 9780227173497",,163,,"Death, judgement, heaven and hell - these are the 'Four Last Things' traditionally linked together under the heading of 'Eschatology'. In this book, John Robinson examines them all with trenchancy and lucidity, providing a new and vital understanding of how these themes relate to contemporary Christian life. In the End, God identifies a gap that exists in the treatment of eschatology within the Christian faith. As Robinson points out, eschatology had traditionally dealt with the last things in a way that is remote and removed from everyday life and Christianity, and the goal of his book is to make eschatology fully relevant to the modern world. Although it is commonly held that eschatology within modern Christianity is centred on the fact and moment of death, Robinson shows that the true nature of eschatology is something quite different. It is not about the last things after everything else, but rather is about the relation of all things to the 'last things' or, as it were, about the 'lastness' of all things. Revealing the foundation of biblical eschatology to be the experience of God by the community of faith, Robinson calls readers to embrace the eschatological vision of the Bible, but to do so in a way that is alert to its mythic character. In the course of these explorations he also lays bare his own theology of universal salvation. However, contrary to what one may expect, this universalism is one that seeks to take both human freedom and the reality of hell with the utmost seriousness. This special edition of John A.T. Robinson's classic text also includes an extended introductory essay by Professor Trevor Hart of the University of St Andrews, and an exchange between Robinson and Thomas F.

About fifty scientists were selected during 1956, and their themes were agreed upon; during 1957 and 1958 they developed the papers that are published here. As these were completed, they were exchanged among the authors. Armed with new information and insights, all but five of the authors met at the University on November 22, 1959, to prepare for panel discussions of the issues in evolution; these were held for the public during a five-day Celebration, beginning on the Centennial of the publication date of Origin of Species. The discus sions were based on the papers that had been prepared and distributed in advance, but were not delivered at the Celebration. The present volume, The Evolution of Life, and its companion volume, The Evolution of Man, represent most of the collected Uni versity of Chicago Centennial papers. A small group on the relation ship between science and spiritual values appears in a third volume, Issues in Evolution, which also contains the panel discussions and an index to all three volumes.

Whence comes its heat? What is the Moon? What are its landscapes like? How does our satellite move? How is it related to the earth? Are the planets globes like that on which we live? How large are they, and how far off? What do we know of the satellites of Jupiter and of the rings of Saturn? How was Uranus discovered? What was the intellectual triumph which brought the planet Neptune to light? Then, as to the other bodies of our system, what are we to say of those mysterious objects, the comets? Can we discover the laws of their seemingly capricious movements? Do we know anything of their nature and of the marvelous tails with which they are often decorated?

The Antiquity of Man,The Antiquity of Man,Sir Charles Lyell,Charles Sir Lyell,1927,2021-05-20,,EAN:4057664604231,407,514,,"In ""The Antiquity of Man,"" Charles Lyell combines the principles of geology with emerging anthropological thought to explore human existence from a scientific perspective. The work is marked by meticulous research and a compelling argument for the deep time of humanity, presenting evidence that challenges contemporary understandings of human history. Lyell's literary style is characterized by precision and clarity, effectively bridging scientific discourse with accessible language. He carefully elucidates the interrelations between geological phenomena and prehistoric life, setting a precedent for interdisciplinary inquiry that would shape future scholarly debates on human evolution. Charles Lyell (1797-1875) was a Scottish geologist whose influential works laid the foundation for modern geology. His seminal ideas on uniformitarianism, the concept that natural processes are consistent over time, and his extensive travels for geological studies provided him with insights that informed ""The Antiquity of Man."" His background in the natural sciences and keen interest in the origins of humankind compelled him to investigate the implications of geological findings on human history, making this book a significant contribution to both science and philosophy. This book is an essential read for anyone interested in the intersection of geology, anthropology, and the history of science. Lyell's rational and evidence-based approach not only expands our understanding of human antiquity but also invites readers to question preconceived notions of human origins. Engaging with this text will enrich your appreciation of the complexities surrounding humanity's place within the natural world.",J. M.

(Ed) Horowitz,Irving Horowitz,1964,2018-04-20,,"9781351305754, 1351305751",640,651,,"In his new introduction to The Anarchists, Horowitz points out that anarchism is an ideology in search of a movement, and also a psychology in search of a polity. While this seems to be a paradox, the fact is that anarchism has more than one hundred thousand entries on electronic search engines, but one can search high and low for a society that embraces its essential anti-Statist vision. At the same time, anarchism continues to attract people to its premises, seemingly generation after generation. Despite similarities in values and goals, anarchism seems especially attractive to those for whom individualism rather than collectivism provides a way of life. In this, it stands at the opposite pole from Behemoth, from the gods of political order. The Anarchists is a rich collection of theories and practices in the words of those who have rebelled against the restrictive institutions and oppressive conditions imposed by state power upon the individual. Idealists and self-seekers, saints and assassins, they have often served as the conscience of the world and have expressed with eloquence and convictions, the deep-seated sense of anarchy that resides, to a greater or lesser degree, in most human beings.Anarchism is not simply a European import; it is deeply rooted in the American political experience. The volume gives strong representation to this side of the anarchist tradition. Thomas Paine wrote, ""Government even in its best state is but a necessary evil. This was a sentiment echoed by Ralph Waldo Emerson, who said, ""the less government we have the better."" The Anarchists offers the most thoughtful and comprehensive selection of writings by and about those who protest against all rule by man over man, particularly that embodied in the State. As such, this anthology presents the history and philosophy of anarchism in the words of thirty-five of its greatest students, observers, and proponents.",Dell Pubishing Co.,Routledge,Politics / Anarchism,Political Science,Paperback,103246,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IFAPEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,88.16,GoogleBooks

Capital Volume 2,Capital (Volume 2),Carl Marx,Karl Marx,1887,2020-12-31,,"1420971778, 9781420971774",,618,,"Karl Marx's second volume in his monumental criticism of capitalism was prepared by Friedrich Engels from notes left for him and published in 1885 two years after Marx's death. The work is organized into the following three sections: 1. The Metamorphoses of Capital and Their Circuits, 2. The Turnover of Capital, and 3. The Reproduction and Circulation of the Aggregate Social Capital. Where the first volume of Capital focuses mainly on the worker and the industrialist, volume two turns its attention more to the owners of capital, merchants, traders, and entrepreneurs. While this work has been largely overshadowed by its predecessor as well as many of Marx's other works, its contributions to the economic analysis of commodities are undoubtedly worthy additions to the corpus of political economic theory. Though history will most likely continue to charge that Marx's recommendations for solving the inadequacies of the capitalistic system as a failure, his analysis regarding those inadequacies will most assuredly continue be considered as a highly thoughtful analysis of the impact of capitalism upon society and may yet one day help to reform the persistent injustices that seem to be inherent within such a system.

Occidentalism,Occidentalism,"Buruma Ian, A Margalit","Ian Buruma, Avishai Margalit",2004,2004,,"1594200084, 9781594200083",,184,a short story of anti-westernism,"A pioneering investigation of the lineage of anti-Western stereotypes that traces them back to the West itself. Twenty-five years ago, Edward Said's Orientalism spawned a generation of scholarship on the denigrating and dangerous mirage of ""the East"" in the Western colonial mind. But ""the West"" is the more dangerous mirage of our own time, Ian Buruma and Avishai Margalit argue, and the idea of ""the West"" in the minds of its self-proclaimed enemies remains largely unexamined and woefully misunderstood. Occidentalism is their groundbreaking investigation of the demonizing fantasies and stereotypes about the Western world that fuel such hatred in the hearts of others. We generally understand ""radical Islam"" as a purely Islamic phenomenon, but Buruma and Margalit show that while the Islamic part of radical Islam certainly is, the radical part owes a primary debt of inheritance to the West. Whatever else they are, al Qaeda and its ilk are revolutionary anti-Western political movements, and Buruma and Margalit show us that the bogeyman of the West who stalks their thinking is the same one who has haunted the thoughts of many other revolutionary groups, going back to the early nineteenth century. In this genealogy of the components of the anti-Western worldview, the same oppositions appear again and again: the heroic revolutionary versus the timid, soft bourgeois; the rootless, deracinated cosmopolitan living in the Western city, cut off from the roots of a spiritually healthy society; the sterile Western mind, all reason and no soul; the machine society, controlled from the center by a cabal of insiders-often Jews-pulling the hidden levers of power versus an organically knit-together one, a society of ""blood and soil."" The anti-Western virus has found a ready host in the Islamic world for a number of legitimate reasons, they argue, but in no way does that make it an exclusively Islamic matter. A work of extraordinary range and erudition, Occidentalismwill permanently enlarge our collective frame of vision.",,Penguin,a critique,History,,103079,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FYvuDj4_GtUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,87.5,GoogleBooks

Both works have had a powerful influence on later Western literature, inspiring poets from Ben Jonson and Alexander Pope to W. H. Auden and Robert Frost.

In the midst of a pivotal era when the age of superstition collided with the world of science and reason, Dee's mathematics anticipated Newton by nearly a century, and his mapmaking and navigation were critical to exploration. Obsessed with alchemy, astrology, and mysticism, his library was one of the finest in Europe, a vast compendium of thousands of volumes.

Letters on Dez Josephmonology and Witchcraft,Letters On Demonology and Witchcraft,Sir Walter Scott,Sir Walter Scott,1831,2019-01-09,,"9783736807860, 3736807864",396,443,,"The book takes the form of ten letters addressed to Lockhart, the epistolary mode permitting Scott to be both conversational in tone and discursive in method. In these, Scott surveys opinions respecting demonology and witchcraft from the Old Testament period to his own day. As a child of the Enlightenment, he adopts a rigorously rational approach to his subject. Supernatural visions are attributed to 'excited passion', to credulity, or to physical illness. The medieval belief in demons is based on Christian ignorance of other religions, leading to the conviction that the gods of the Muslim or Pagan nations were fiends and their priests conjurers or wizards. In the post-Reformation period, the primitive state of science and predominance of mystical explanations of natural phenomena fed fear of witchcraft. In the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, witches were hunted with near-hysterical zeal. Examining Scottish criminal trials for witchcraft, Scott notes that the nature of evidence admissible gave free reign to accusers and left the accused no chance of escape. Prisoners were driven to confess through despair and the desire to avoid future persecution. Scott also observes that trials for witchcraft were increasingly connected with political crimes, just as in Catholic countries accusations of witchcraft and heresy went together. Advances in science and the spread of rational philosophy during the eighteenth century eventually undermined the belief in supernatural phenomena, although pockets of superstition remain. Scott's account is amply illustrated with anecdotes and traditional tales and may be read as an anthology of uncanny stories as much as a philosophical treatise.",John Murray,BookRix,Witchcraft,History,Hardback,104513,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AsqzAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,86.36,GoogleBooks

It is my intention to give under the head of each species only such facts as I have been able to collect or observe, showing the amount and nature of the changes which animals and plants have undergone whilst under man's dominion, or which bear on the general principles of variation. In one case alone, namely in that of the domestic pigeon, I will describe fully all the chief races, their history, the amount and nature of their differences, and the probable steps by which they have been formed. I have selected this case, because, as we shall hereafter see, the materials are better than in any other; and one case fully described will in fact illustrate all others. But I shall also describe domesticated rabbits, fowls, and ducks, with considerable fullness. We are delighted to publish this classic book as part of our extensive Classic Library collection.

Foote, readers are immersed in a collection of thought-provoking essays and articles that challenge traditional religious beliefs and advocate for skepticism and intellectual freedom. The literary style is clear, direct, and persuasive, reflecting the author's commitment to rational inquiry and critical thinking. Set within the context of the late 19th century when religious dogma was being increasingly questioned, this book serves as a manifesto for freethinkers seeking to challenge societal norms and superstitions. Foote's sharp wit and incisive arguments make this work a standout in the realm of skepticism and freethought literature. G. W. Foote, a prominent British freethinker and editor of 'The Freethinker' magazine, was known for his fierce opposition to religious authority and advocacy for secular humanism. His experiences with censorship and legal battles informed his writing, making 'Flowers of Freethought (Second Series)' a testament to his unwavering dedication to the principles of reason and evidence-based thinking. I highly recommend 'Flowers of Freethought (Second Series)' to readers interested in exploring the history of freethought movements and the ongoing battle between religious orthodoxy and secular skepticism. Foote's eloquent prose and uncompromising stance on critical inquiry make this book a must-read for anyone seeking to challenge ingrained beliefs and embrace intellectual independence.","Foote, G W London",Good Press,Freethought,Philosophy,Hardback,101256,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wQbDDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,85.87,GoogleBooks

We must now resume the narrative at the point where we left it - to wit, Saturday, 4th April, 33. This will be for some time yet a continuation, in some sort, of the Life of Jesus. Next, after the months of joyous rapture, during which the great Founder laid the foundation of a new order for humanity, these last years were the most decisive in the history of the world. It is still Jesus, some sparks of whose sacred fire have been deposited in the hearts of a few friends who created institutions of the greatest originality, moves, transforms souls, imprints upon everything his divine seal. We have to show how, under this ever active and victorious influence over death, the faith of the resurrection, the influence of the Holy Spirit, the gift of tongues, and the power of the Church, established themselves. We shall describe the organization of the Church at Jerusalem, its first trials, its first conquests, the earliest missions which it despatched. We shall follow Christianity in its rapid progress in Syria, as far as Antioch, where was formed a second capital, more important in a sense than that of Jerusalem, which it was destined to supplant. In this new centre, where the converted Pagansconstituted the majority, we shall see Christianity separating itself definitely from Judaism, and receiving a name of its own; we shall see especially the birth of the grand idea of distant missions, destined to carry the name of Jesus into the world of the Gentiles. We shall pause at the important moment when Paul, Barnabas, and John Mark set out for the execution of this great design. There we shall interrupt our narrative, and cast a glance at the world which those daring missionaries undertook to convert. We shall endeavour to give an account of the intellectual, political, religious, and social condition of the Roman Empire about the year 45, the probable date of the departure of Saint Paul upon his first mission.

And three young men—Desborough, Challoner and Somerset—are bored stiff. So this trio make a pact. They’ll alleviate their listlessness by seeking out adventures wherever they can. These adventures form ""The Dynamiter"", a collection of loosely inter-connected stories, which features everything from violent Mormons to ghostly mansions. Veering from suspense to comedy, it’s a fun and light read. And for Stevenson fans, an interesting curio because it’s his only book written in collaboration with his wife, Fanny van de Grift Stevenson. Robert Louis Stevenson (1850–1894) was a Scottish novelist, poet and travel writer. Born in Edinburgh, he suffered from severe health issues for most of his life. Despite this, he still managed to produce some of the century’s most famous stories. These include the classic adventure ""Treasure Island"" and the horror novella ""The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"". Stevenson’s last years were spent on the Samoan island of Upolo, where he became an advocate for Samoan rights.

Anti - Duhring,Anti-Duhring,Frederick Engels,Friedrich Engels,1977,2015-03-23,,"1508934274, 9781508934271",519,434,,"Marx and Engels first became aware of Professor Dühring with his December 1867 review of Capital, published in Ergänzungsblätter. They exchanged a series of letters about him from January-March 1868.He was largely forgotten until the mid-1870s, at which time Dühring entered Germany's political foreground. German Social-Democrats were influenced by both his Kritische Geschichte der Nationalökonomie und des Sozialismus and Cursus der Philosophie als streng wissenschaftlicher Weltanschauung und Lebensgestaltung. Among his readers were included Johann Most, Friedrich Wilhelm Fritzsche, Eduard Bernstein - and even August Bebel for a brief period.In March 1874, the Social-Democratic Workers' Party paper Volksstaat ran an anonymous article (actually penned by Bebel) favorably reviewing one of Dühring's books.On both February 1 and April 21, 1875, Liebknecht encouraged Engels to take Dühring head-on in the pages of the Volksstaat. In February 1876, Engels fired an opening salvo with his Volksstaat article ""Prussian Vodka in the German Reichstag"".On May 24, 1876, Engels wrote Marx, saying there was cause to initiate a campaign against the spread of Dühring's views. Marx replied the next day, saying Dühring himself should be sharply criticised. So Engels put aside his work on what would later become known as the book Dialectics of Nature. On May 28, he outlined to Marx the general strategy he planned to take against Dühring. It would take over two years to complete.The book breaks into three distinct parts:Part I: Philosophy - Written mainly between September 1876 and January 1877. Published as a series of articles entitled Herrn Eugen Dühring's Umwälzung der Philosophie in Vorwärts between January and May 1877. Later, beginning in 1878, with the first separate edition, the first two chapters of this part were made into an independent general introduction to all three parts.Part II: Political Economy - Written mainly between June and August 1877. (The last chapter was actually written by Marx.) Published under the title Herrn Eugen Dühring's Umwälzung der politischen Oekonomie in Wissenschaftliche Beilage and in the supplement to Vorwärts between July and December 1877.Part III: Socialism - Written mainly between August 1877 and April 1878. Published as Herrn Eugen Dühring's Umwälzung des Sozialismus in the supplement to Vorwärts between May and July 1878.The Vorwärts serials elicited objections from Dühring's loyal adherents: during the May 27 1877 congress of the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany, they attempted to ban the on-going publication of it in the Party paper. Indeed, the sporadic delays in publication were largely due to their efforts.In July 1877, Part I was published as a pamphlet. In July 1878, Parts II and III were combined into a second pamphlet.In early July 1878, the complete work was first published as a book - with an added preface by Engels. In October 1878, Germany's Anti-Socialist Law was instituted and Anti-Dühring was banned along with Engels' other works. In 1886, a second edition appeared in Zurich. The third, revised and supplemented edition was published in Stuttgart, in 1894, i.e., after the Anti-Socialist Law was repealed (1890). This was the last edition during Engels' lifetime. It was translated into English for the first time in 1907, in Chicago.In 1880, at Paul Lafargue's request, Engels took three chapters of Anti-Dühring and created one would become one of the most popular socialist pamphlets in the world: Socialism: Utopian and Scientific.",Progress Publishers,CreateSpace,Politics / Philosophy,,Hardback,103650,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9zRLrgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,84.6,GoogleBooks

Deploying a scholarly literary style that is both accessible and incisive, Phelips engages with critical topics such as secularism, existentialism, and the philosophical ramifications of scientific advancements. The work is situated within a broader context of 20th-century religious thought, where Phelips adeptly examines the ways in which Christian institutions respond to, and sometimes resist, the challenges posed by modernity. Vivian Phelips, a noted theologian and philosopher, is influenced by a rich educational background steeped in both religious studies and philosophy. His work arises from a personal and intellectual inquiry into the faith'Äôs relevance in a rapidly changing world, set against the backdrop of two world wars and the cultural upheavals that defined the 1900s. This personal journey is evident in Phelips'Äô poignant discussions that seek not only to challenge but also to reconcile tradition with innovation. For readers interested in the dialogue between faith and reason, ""The Churches and Modern Thought"" is an indispensable resource.

The first Of these questions needs only to be asked to be answered in the negative. A whole Of which the parts are alive, cannot, in its general characters, be like lifeless wholes. The second question, not to be thus promptly answered, is to be answered in the affirmative.

Botticelli,Botticelli,Giulio Carlo Argan,Susan Sloman,1957,2004,,UOM:39015060615286,146,140,,"Botticelli's art has proved more magnetic to historians and critics during the past hundred years than that of any other fifteenth century painter. His linear evocations of feminine grace and beauty, epitomized in his celebrated allegorical compositions 'Primavera' and 'The Birth of Venus', have entered the repertory of potent and immediately recognizable images, representing the classical ideal of the Italian Renaissance. His celestially serene Madonnas and sweet-tempered angels have become inseparable from the notion of religious sublimity and devotion in the quattrocento. Susan Legouix offers a fresh and stimulating account of the art and the world of Botticelli. She charts the development of Botticelli's style, his growing assurance and his ultimate adoption of an almost backward-looking, Gothic but deeply personal idiom. The demands of his public commissions for churches and their effect upon his style are measured and balanced against his private modes, especially his illustrations for Dante's Divine Comedy, which confirm his genius as a draughtsman and an interpreter. Special attention is also paid to the shifting taste of succeeding centuries and the Victorian revival of interest in Botticelli's work which has raised him to the position of one of the supreme if also most enigmatic masters of western art.",Skira,,Art History / Botticelli,Art,Hardback,100672,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TNnqAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,83.33,GoogleBooks

The French Revolution,The French Revolution,Archibald Robertson,Hilaire Belloc,1949,2022-09-15,,EAN:8596547384298,182,177,,"Hilaire Belloc's 'The French Revolution' is a seminal work that draws on a rich vein of historical insights to recount the complex narrative of one of history's most transformative events. Belloc's narrative is characterized by a meticulous attention to detail and a lively prose style that brings the epochal events of the late 18th century to life. This book serves not only as a comprehensive chronicle of the Revolution but also as an analysis of the social, political, and cultural undercurrents that precipitated this seismic shift in French, and indeed global, history. Published with exceptional care by DigiCat Publishing, this edition ensures that every word honors the profound legacy of Belloc's scholarship within the wider literary canon of historical discourse. Hilaire Belloc, regarded as one of the most prolific writers of his time, brought a unique combination of erudition and personal experience to his writing on history. An Anglo-French writer and historian with a profound understanding of both British and French cultural milieus, Belloc's own bicultural heritage enabled him to delve deeply into the subtleties of the Revolution. His work, beyond its historical narrative, reflects a deep engagement with the ideological and spiritual dimensions of the period, influenced by his own Catholic faith and conservative viewpoints. This foundation, underpinning his analysis of the Revolution, renders a perspective that offers valuable insights into the motivations and consequences of this great upheaval. For scholars and aficionados of historical literature, 'The French Revolution' by Hilaire Belloc stands out as an essential addition to their libraries. Students of history will particularly benefit from Belloc's expertise, his commanding grasp of the period's complex socio-political landscape, and the ways in which these revolutionary events echo into the present day. Readers will come away from this work not only with a greater knowledge of French history but also with a deeper understanding of the forces that shape human societies. This DigiCat edition, with its commitment to preserving and disseminating Belloc's formidable legacy, caters to both the dedicated academic and the passionate lay reader, ensuring the revolutionary spirit and its lessons live on.",Watts & Co.,DigiCat,History / France,History,Hardback,102914,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=T6yKEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,82.89,GoogleBooks

The nineteenth century was a time of social, cultural, and economic change; revolutionary scientific developments; and enduring imaginative works. This book explores the classic horror genre of Gothic literature in its historical and social contexts. It contains chapters on four major works of classic horror, with each chapter providing a mix of background information, primary source historical documents, and analysis that will appeal as much to high school and college students as to lovers of literature and the Victorian era. Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner is contextualized through documents pertaining to British imperialism, Antarctic Exploration, and the burgeoning environmentalist movement. Shelley's Frankenstein is explored through sections on galvanism, electricity, grave robbing, and the vitalist debate.

The proposition would have been as self-evident, as that all the buds on the same tree are alike, though neither proposition is strictly true. For, as has often been remarked, probably no two individuals are identically the same. All wild animals recognise each other, which shows that there is some difference between them; and when the eye is well practised, the shepherd knows each sheep, and man can distinguish a fellow-man out of millions on millions of other men. Some authors have gone so far as to maintain that the production of slight differences is as much a necessary function of the powers of generation, as the production of offspring like their parents. This view, as we shall see in a future chapter, is not theoretically probable, though practically it holds good. The saying that ""like begets like"" has in fact arisen from the perfect confidence felt by breeders, that a superior or inferior animal will generally reproduce its kind; but this very superiority or inferiority shows that the individual in question has departed slightly from its type. We are delighted to publish this classic book as part of our extensive Classic Library collection. Many of the books in our collection have been out of print for decades, and therefore have not been accessible to the general public. The aim of our publishing program is to facilitate rapid access to this vast reservoir of literature, and our view is that this is a significant literary work, which deserves to be brought back into print after many decades. The contents of the vast majority of titles in the Classic Library have been scanned from the original works. To ensure a high quality product, each title has been meticulously hand curated by our staff.

He openly criticizes the Bible and many of the fallacies contained within, as well as providing a shrewd analysis of Christianity and how it developed from its pagan ancestry-arguments many critics claim carry weight today. Being an idealist, a radical, and a master rhetorician, Paine wrote and lived with a keen sense of urgency and excitement. However, he alienated many of his countrymen with his incendiary viewpoints. Forced to leave America for England, Paine eventually returned to the United States in 1802, though he remained all but ostracized. He died in poverty seven years later in 1809. THOMAS PAINE (1737-1809) was an Anglo-American political theorist and writer born in Norfolk, England. In 1774, Paine emigrated to America, bearing letters of introduction from Benjamin Franklin. Soon thereafter, he became involved in the clashes between England and the American colonies and published the enormously successful pamphlet Common Sense in 1776, which was widely distributed and contributed to the patriot cause throughout the American Revolution.",Mentor,"Cosimo, Inc.",Philosophy,Political Science,Paperback,101482,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tzCCJItNOO4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,82.35,GoogleBooks

The Apocalypse of St. John,The Apocalypse of St. John,H. B. Swete,Irma Korte,,2022-04-05,,"9789526985008, 9526985001",,150,"The Greek text with introductions, notes and indices","The Apocalypse—or the Revelation of St. John the Divine, the last book in the Bible—has inspired many artists over the centuries to present their own perceptions of its events and characters. What might a woman clothed with the sun, a dragon with seven heads, the harlot of Babylon, the New Jerusalem, and paradise look like? Irma Korte has gathered a collection of more than 60 such color illustrations here, made during the Middle Ages and Early Renaissance. The images trace the events of the Apocalypse of St. John, rendering its central figures and episodes lifelike for us. They are accompanied by an insightful interpretation: Dr. Korte suggests that the Revelation deals with the most essential problems in religion, such as the nature of man, reality, and evil. As the visions proceed, St. John lives through a profound inner transformation. He gives up shallow beliefs and moves toward personally experienced spirituality, culminating in final liberation. St. John, like anyone who has traveled the same path, undergoes both anxiety and bliss, encounters beasts and enjoys the happiness of paradise. The images and events of the Revelation are compared to the descriptions made by Christian mystics and saints, as well as to Oriental philosophy and yoga theory. These saints and rishis include, among others, St. Teresa of Avila, St. John of the Cross, Ramana Maharshi, and Paramahansa Yogananda. Mythical images allow for many interpretations. Readers may use these old and strangely captivating illustrations as a source of inspiration to find their own meaning in St. John’s visions. Irma Korte, Ph.D., has published several books and articles. She elaborated her interpretation of the Apocalypse of St. John in her earlier work The Revelation of St. John—An Inner Journey to Liberation, which is a detailed study of the Revelation. It offers more comparisons to the images of the Apocalypse of St. John from different cultures and time periods.",WM.

This book critically examines the best biblical and historical scholarship before tackling head-on some of the key questions of systematic Christology: does orthodox faith present Jesus the man as deficient and depersonalized? Is his sinlessness compatible with the exercise of a free human will? Does up-to-date exegesis challenge his virginal conception and personal resurrection? Can one reconcile Jesus' role as universal Saviour with the truth and values to be found in other religions? What should the feminist movement highlight in presenting Jesus? This integral Christology is built around the resurrection of the crucified Jesus, highlights love as the key to redemption, and proposes a synthesis of the divine presence through Jesus.

Did Jesus Rise From the Dead?,Did Jesus Rise from the Dead?,A G & Flew Habermas,Matthew Levering,1956,2019-02-21,,"9780192575616, 0192575619",,337,,"The Resurrection of Jesus is at the very root of Christian faith; without belief in Jesus Christianity dies. In this thought-provoking work, Matthew Levering defends the credibility of the claim that Jesus rose from the dead. Drawing on the work of N. T. Wright, Levering shows that the historical evidence vindicates this assumption, and reveals that the Gospels were backed by eyewitnesses who were living and telling their stories even during the time of the writing of the Gospels. The author also emphasises the importance of evaluating the Old Testament to validate Jesus' Resurrection. By highlighting the desire--both in the ancient world and now--to make the Resurrection more comprehensible by spiritualizing it, Levering argues that the fact that the disciples themselves did not do this provides a further clue to reliability. Finally, the author addresses the question of why Jesus does not continue to show himself in his glorified flesh after his resurrection, which is often seen as a strong case for scepticism. However, he shows that Jesus' entire mission is predicated upon helping us to avoid cleaving to the present world over God. He is leading us to where he is--the kingdom of God, the beginning of the new creation at the Father's right hand. By developing these arguments for the historical reality of Jesus' Resurrection, this ground-breaking study expertly draws together historical and theological reasons for believing that Jesus' Resurrection happened.",,Oxford University Press,,Religion,,101483,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eMKKDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,81.58,GoogleBooks

Prehistory,Prehistory,A Vayson de Pradenne,Chris Gosden,1940,2018-06-21,,"9780192525307, 0192525301",239,163,,"Prehistory covers the period of some 4 million years before the start of written history, when our earliest ancestors, the Australopithecines, existed in Africa. But this is relatively recent compared to whole history of the earth of some 4.5 billion years. A key aspect of prehistory is that it provides a sense of scale, throwing recent ways of life into perspective. Humans and their ancestors lived in many different ways and the cultural variety we see now is just a tiny fraction of that which has existed over millions of years. Humans are part of the broader evolution of landscapes and communities of plants and animals, but Homo sapiens is also the only species to have made a real impact on planetary systems. To understand such an impact, we need a grasp of our longest term development and ways of life. In this new edition of his Very Short Introduction, Chris Gosden invites us to think seriously about who we are by considering who we have been. As he explains, many new discoveries have been made in archaeology over the last ten years, and a new framework for prehistory is emerging. A greater understanding of Chinese and central Asian prehistory has thrown Eurasian prehistory in quite a different light, with flows of the influence of culture over large areas now evident. This has eaten away at the traditional view of human progress around the invention of agriculture, the development of cities and (much later) the industrial revolution, and given us new geographies to think about. Chris Gosden explores the new landscape of our prehistory, and considers the way the different geographical locations weave together.

Below is an example of the information you will find in The Ten Commandments: Commandment 3 - Do Not Misuse God's Name Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain. Principle- God's name is holy, powerful and glorious. Meaning- God's name is holy and should be treated with respect. there is power in the LORD's name and it shouldn't be used lightly. Because God is Spirit, we know Him through what He says about Himself, to take His name in vain violates God's nature. As God's creation, everything a person says and does should be done in order to praise and glorify God. (1 Corinthians 10:31) Bible examples- When a man named Shelomith blasphemed the name of God with a curse, the Lord commanded that he be taken outside the camp and stoned to death. (Leviticus 24:10-16) Jesus was accused of blasphemy because He claimed to be God. (John 10:33) James warned believers to watch what they say because the tongue is capable of evil and poison and can easily corrupt a person.

If we can show respect for the names of our fathers, mothers, teachers and doctors, then how much more should we respect the name of our sovereign God.

Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel is one of the greatest thinkers of all time. No other philosopher has had such a profound impact on the ideas and political events of the 20th century. Hegel's influential writings on philosophy, politics, history and art are parts of a larger systematic whole. They are also among the most difficult in the entire literature of philosophy. Introducing Hegel guides us through a spectacular system of thought which aimed to make sense of history. The book also provides new perspectives on contemporary postmodern debates about 'metanarratives' (Lyotard) and the 'end of history' (Fukuyama). It is an ideal introduction to this crucial figure in the history of philosophy, and is indispensable for anyone trying to understand such key modern thinkers as Marx, Lacan, Satre and Adorno.",Icon Books Lmtd U.K.,Icon Books Ltd,Philosophy,Philosophy,,106453,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=m-nXCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,81.25,GoogleBooks

In this book Roger Scruton presents a clear and systematic analysis of Spinoza's thought, and shows its relevance to today's intellectual preoccupations.

Henry Fielding,Henry Fielding,Britannica Encyclopedia,Simon Varey,1952,1986,,UCAL:B4973202,,172,The history of Tom Jones “a foundling”,"This concise and lucid study provides an ideal introduction to the major work of Henry Fielding for all students. Fielding's stature as a great comic novelist is assured, but as Professor Varey illustrates, he was a remarkably versatile writer. In his day Fielding was one of England's leading dramatists and also pursued a career in law. He founded, edited, and contributed essays for four different periodicals, and wrote a political-satirical novel Jonathan Wild, in addition to a work of powerful social protest Amelia and his two outstanding contributions to the development of English prose fiction: Tom Jones and Joseph Andrews. Professor Varey clarifies and explains this varied body of writing, concentrating on Fielding's technique of combining opposites or apparently ill-matched elements - of language, character, narrative made, and even philosophical thought.",Published with the Editorial advice of the faculties of the University of Chicago,CUP Archive,,Literary Criticism,,102018,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LfRPAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,80.43,GoogleBooks
Sigmund Freud,Sigmund Freud,Britannica Encyclopedia,Jean-Michel Quinodoz,1952,2017-07-14,,"9781315303895, 1315303892",,142,The major works of Sigmund Freud,"Jean-Michel Quinodoz introduces the essential life and work of Sigmund Freud, from the beginning of his clinical experiences in Vienna in the 1880s to his final years in London in the 1930s. Freud’s discoveries, including universally-influential concepts like the Oedipus complex and the interpretation of dreams, continue to be applied in many disciplines today. Elegantly and clearly written, each chapter leaves the reader with a solid framework for understanding key Freudian concepts, and an appetite for further knowledge. Accessible for readers inside and outside the field of psychoanalysis, there is nothing at all equivalent in English. The book starts with Freud’s life before the discovery of psychoanalysis, spanning from 1856 to 1900, when The Interpretation of Dreams was published. The subsequent chapters are devoted to the presentation of the key notions of psychoanalysis. A chronological perspective shows how Freud's work has been constantly enriched by the successive contributions of Freud himself, as well as his successors. Freud’s contributions are also embedded in the daily, clinical practice of psychoanalysis and psychotherapy. The last chapter concerns Freud’s life from 1900 to 1939, the year of his death. This fascinating, concise and accessible introduction to the life and work of Sigmund Freud, one of the most influential and revolutionary figures of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, by internationally-renowned author Jean-Michel Quinodoz, will appeal to both professional readers and anyone with an interest in psychoanalysis, psychotherapy and the history of ideas.. The book presents the major contributions of Sigmund Freud in their nascent state, as and when they appeared, and shows that they are as alive today as ever.",Published with the Editorial advice of the faculties of the University of Chicago,Routledge,,Psychology,,101195,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5fQ-DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,80.43,GoogleBooks

Collected Poems,Collected Poems,John Masefield,Lorna Goodison,1923,2017-04-15,,"9781784104672, 1784104671",,629,,"Lorna Goodison is a poet alive to places, from the loved and lived-in world of Jamaica where she began and started a family, to the United States and Canada where she has made her teaching career, but always re-connecting with her Caribbean roots. She travels with an ear alert to histories and voices. How differently English sounds in the tropi and in colder lands, at seaside in sunlight and on prairies, mountains and in cities. The same words say quite different things, depending on who speaks them and who's listening, obeying or resisting. She covers a wide range of subjects and themes, too. Her instinct is to celebrate being alive in a world that is rich but in peril. 'And what is the rare quality that has gone out of poetry that these marvellous poems restore?' asks Derek Walcott. 'Joy.' The 'mango of poetry', eaten straight from the tree, Goodison somehow finds growing in Wordsworth country and in Sligo, in Russia and Norway, in Spain and Portugal which spilled their empires into the Caribbean, in Hungary and Far Rockaway. // 'The publication of Lorna Goodison's Collected Poems – with their extraordinary music, sensuous texture, and powerful historical imagination – is a major event. These are poems stunningly alive to the nuances of language, beautifully pitched and tuned, rich with feeling and insight.' Jahan Ramazani // 'Lorna Goodison brings herself into the presence of every poem, and so into the presence of her readers. Like the ideal teacher, she enables us to hear history sing its joy and shout its rage in her own personal tones of voice, and to feel the folds and textures of her various homelands like a display of rich cloths. She excels in both the emblematic and descriptive powers of popular poetry, and introduces us to an array of characters sharply but generously perceived, and often as deliciously audible after death as in life. This is an inspiring collection for a time when hopes for transnational unity are profoundly challenged. Goodison's poems frequently acknowledge the complex unhealed scars of imperial greed and violence, but the impulse is towards hope, and our imaginations are enchanted by a potential global spring of warmth, nourishment, camaraderie and sheer fun. In the poet's own words of gratitude to ""Miss Mirry African bush healing woman"", we should ""turn thanks now"" to Lorna Goodison for addressing us across so many years on her unique world-service of human truth – and stay tuned.'

Looking forward, he examines the future in store for states: will they gain or lose strength as they are buffeted by globalization, terrorism, economic crisis and environmental disaster?

Drawing in the movement's varied relationships with the arts, humanism, and politics, this book clarifies the philosophy and original meaning of 'existentialism' - which has tended to be obscured by misappropriation. Placing it in its historical context, Thomas Flynn also highlights how existentialism is still relevant to us today.

All the older traditions need to be reinteerpreted in terms of modern conditions --which, after all, is what the Eurasian scholastics of these centuries were doing for their own time. The major developments of this period are Monism in Many Moods during the ninth century, through Exfoliation and Elaboration of those seminal systems in the tenth and eleventh centuries unitl the time of the Great Summas in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. It was during this time that philosophy and theology developed a very highly sophisticated technique of balancing arguments and refutations and counter-arguments and counter-refutations.

From childhood most of us develop a sense of the mysterious, malign person, usually an old woman. Historically, too, we recognize witch-hunting as a feature of pre-modern societies. But why do witches still feature so heavily in our cultures and consciousness? From Halloween to superstitions, and literary references such as Faust and even Harry Potter, witches still feature heavily in our society. In this Very Short Introduction Malcolm Gaskill challenges all of this, and argues that what we think we know is, in fact, wrong. Taking a historical perspective from the ancient world to contemporary paganism, Gaskill reveals how witchcraft has meant different things to different people and that in every age it has raised questions about the distinction between fantasy and reality, faith and proof. Telling stories, delving into court records, and challenging myths, Gaskill examines the witch-hunts of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and explores the reinvention of witchcraft - as history, religion, fiction, and metaphor.

People knew the basics: men and women had sex, and sometimes babies followed. But beyond that the origins of life were a colossal mystery. The Seeds of Life is the remarkable and rollicking story of how a series of blundering geniuses and brilliant amateurs struggled for two centuries to discover where, exactly, babies come from. Taking a page from investigative thrillers, acclaimed science writer Edward Dolnick looks to these early scientists as if they were detectives hot on the trail of a bedeviling and urgent mystery. These strange searchers included an Italian surgeon using shark teeth to prove that female reproductive organs were not 'failed' male genitalia, and a Catholic priest who designed ingenious miniature pants to prove that frogs required semen to fertilize their eggs.

In this eagerly awaited English translation of Le Règne de l’homme, the last volume of Rémi Brague's trilogy on the philosophical development of anthropology in the West, Brague argues that, with the dawn of the Enlightenment, Western societies rejected the transcendence of the past and looked instead to the progress fostered by the early modern present and the future. As scientific advances drained the cosmos of literal mystery, humanity increasingly devalued the theophilosophical mystery of being in favor of omniscience over one’s own existence. Brague narrates the intellectual disappearance of the natural order, replaced by a universal chaos upon which only humanity can impose order; he cites the vivid histories of the nation-state, economic evolution into capitalism, and technology as the tools of this new dominion, taken up voluntarily by humans for their own ends rather than accepted from the deity for a divine purpose. Brague’s tour de force begins with the ancient and medieval confidence in humanity as the superior creation of Nature or of God, epitomized in the biblical wish of the Creator for humans to exert stewardship over the earth. He sees the Enlightenment as a transition period, taking as a given that humankind should be masters of the world but rejecting the imposition of that duty by a deity. Before the Enlightenment, who the creator was and whom the creator dominated were clear. With the advance of modernity and banishment of the Creator, who was to be dominated? Today, Brague argues, “our humanism . . . is an anti-antihumanism, rather than a direct affirmation of the goodness of the human.” He ends with a sobering question: does humankind still have the will to survive in an era of intellectual self-destruction? The Kingdom of Man will appeal to all readers interested in the history of ideas, but will be especially important to political philosophers, historical anthropologists, and theologians.",Watts & Co.,University of Notre Dame Pess,Anthropology,Philosophy,Hardback,101921,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PKlVDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,78.95,GoogleBooks

A. A. Long, a leading scholar of later ancient philosophy, gives the definitive presentation of the thought of Epictetus for a broad readership. Long's fresh and vivid translations of a selection of the best of Epictetus' discourses show that his ideas are as valuable and striking today as they were amost two thousand years ago. The translations are organized thematically within the framework of an authoritative introduction and commentary, which offer a way into this world for those new to it, and illuminating interpretations for those who already know it. Epictetus is known as one of the great Stoic thinkers. But he took the life and conversation of Socrates as his educational model. His Socratic allegiance, scarcely examined before, is a major theme of this ground-breaking book. Long shows how Epictetus offered his students a way of life premised on the values of personal autonomy and integrity. Never a sermonizer, Epictetus engages his students in brilliantly challenging dialogue; Long offers the first accessible study of his argumentative and rhetorical methods.

The advice in this book can help you deal with specific emotional problems. This book provides support for those suffering from mental distress and unable to get immediate medical or psychological help. The book covers a comprehensive range of emotional disorders. The advice is intended to be the first step to recovery. Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) empowers you to understand the problem in a way that will maximise your potential to tackle future obstacles and become more independent. You will be successfully helped to mobilise your own resources, and improve your sense of self-effectiveness, by being enabled to attribute the cause of change to your own efforts. CBT concentrates on the connections between a person’s thoughts about themselves or a situation and how this affects feelings and behaviour. Together the patient and therapist work to understand and alter the negative thinking and behaviour that result in distress and prevent the patient from living a normal life. CBT can be used for a variety of disorders and aims to tackle the root cause of the illness, reducing the need for drugs at all in some cases. For other illnesses, CBT is being developed as a partner for drugs. ‘A Better Life’ includes information, tools and exercises to enable you to gain insight into your problems; start making changes for the better; recover and move forward with confidence and prevent relapses so you maintain your progress. You will experience an increase in power and control over your problems from gaining a different perspective and examining the roots of your problems. As your self-awareness and personal insight develop, you will feel new energy and self-acceptance. By exploring your thoughts, feelings and behaviour you will be able to face decisions and choices on your own more resourcefully. You will find the opportunity to make sense of your life and be able to plan changes that will make a difference to your future.",Printed in South Korea,Chipmunkapublishing ltd,Atheist,,,106635,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2T7-CQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,78.85,GoogleBooks

Vatican correspondent John L. Allen draws on his unparalleled knowledge to give the full inside story of the Church's new leadership. In this in-depth account he examines the transition from John Paul II to Benedict XVI, the legacy of the previous Pope and the role of the current leader. He takes us right into the heart of the selection process, interviewing the cardinals who chose Benedict XVI to reveal their thoughts on the new Pope and the reasons why he was picked. And he looks at why this conclave was one of the briefest of modern times. Confronting many difficult questions, Allen asks what the choice of a renowned 'hard line' traditionalist will mean for 1.1 billion Catholics around the globe. What do the way Ratzinger rose to power, his history and theological views say about how the faith will now move forward? Why did the Vatican choose such a seemingly safe candidate?

Long out of print, this lively, eminently readable edition is at last available in a paperback. Unlike many prose translations, Rees's version captures the true poetry of the Iliad, transforming the dactylic hexameters into a loose pentameter that is both familiar and accessible to modern readers. The result is natural, free-flowing language that brings to life the compelling tale of the heroes and gods who fought the Trojan War. As with the best translations of poetry, Rees's Iliad is a poem in its own right without losing the spirit and meaning of the the original work. With a brief yet insightful introduction, a text unencumbered with scholarly notes or line numbers, and an extremely helpful index to names and places, this is an Iliad for all readers, and one that will provide a lifetime of enjoyment.",Oxford university Press,"Oxford University Press, USA",,Language Arts & Disciplines,,106280,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=33tiAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,78.57,GoogleBooks

Theories has had a long history of being in-and-out of publication, and particularly in-and-out of being an actually accessible publication. In 1905, the infamously-hated-by-Lenin Karl Kautsky, published the first edition of the manuscript in three volumes separated and rearranged by Adam Smith in volume one, to David Ricardo in the other two volumes, with the breakup of the Ricardian school as the third volume. Kautsy's version circulated in print and was translated to many languages over the decades, remaining the sole version of Theories until The Institute of Marxism-Leninism published a new German version. This arrangement, while still relatively close to Kautsy's narrative arrangement of tracing surplus value from Smith to the Ricardian split into ""vulgar economics,"" annotated the manuscript with different topic headings. This version was then translated into English by Progress Publishers and this is the version of the book which circulates today and is considered to be the most accurate version to Marx's notebooks.

This second volume of Theories of Surplus Value covers Smith, Ricardo, and Rodbertus' theories of rent, to the theory of cost-price, to growth and productivity in agricultural labor, to extensive diagrams on rent and the influence of machines. These three volumes, in totality, are to show how the classical theories of value led to a theory stuck within the market paradigm and caught in the loop of capitalist circularity.

In Authoritarianism: What Everyone Needs to Know®, Erica Frantz guides us through today's authoritarian wave, explaining how it came to be and what its features are. She also looks at authoritarians themselves, focusing in particular on the techniques they use to take power, the strategies they use to survive, and how they fall. Understanding how politics works in authoritarian regimes and recognizing the factors that either give rise to them or trigger their downfall is ever-more important given current global trends, and this book paves the ways for such an understanding.

Born in 1912 to an unconventional family of modest means, Elsa Morante grew up with an independent spirit, a formidable will, and an unshakable commitment to writing. Forced to hide from the Fascists during World War II in a remote mountain hut with her husband, renowned author Alberto Moravia, she re-emerged at war's end to take her place among the premier Italian writers of her day. When Rome was film capital of the world, she counted Pasolini, Visconti, and the young Bertolucci among her circle of friends. She was charismatic, beautiful, and fiercely intelligent; her marriage, a passionate union of literary giants, captivated a nation; her love affairs were intense and often tragic.

If I Were God,If I Were God,William Robinson,SRASHTI BEHURE,1930,2021-06-30,,,186,,,"Humans often, under dire situations, end up cursing and thrashing the belief in the Almighty. A man is thankful of Him and His blessings if they work in his favour and aid him to grow and glow. Yet, there comes a time when nothing in life seems to be going his way and he feels that God just isn't there for him anymore; not standing beside him, deaf to all his prayers and blind to all his miseries. Isn't that the moment when a man's strongest urge is to become a God himself and make every little affliction and sorrow vanish off the face of his life with just one flick of a finger? ""If I Were God"" is a compendium of several such moments in the form of short stories, poems and essays, put into relatable words by our remarkable bunch of writers.

Does this fact give rise to moral concern? Egalitarianism claims that it does, for a wide array of reasons. It is one of the most important and hotly debated problems in moral and political philosophy, occupying a central place in the work of John Rawls, Thomas Nagel, G. A. Cohen and Derek Parfit. It also plays an important role in practical contexts such as the allocation of health care resources, the design of education and tax systems, and the pursuit of global justice. Egalitarianism is a superb introduction to the problem of contemporary egalitarian theories. It explains how rival theories of egalitarianism evaluate distributions of people’s well-being, and carefully assesses the theoretical structure of each theory. It also examines how egalitarian theories are applied to the distribution of health and health care, thus bringing a deceptively complex philosophical debate into clear focus. Beginning with a brief introduction to basic terminology, Iwao Hirose examines the following topics: Rawlsian egalitarianism luck egalitarianism telic egalitarianism prioritarianism sufficientarianism equality and time equality in health and health care. Including chapter summaries, annotated further reading and a glossary, this is an ideal starting point for anyone studying distributive justice for the first time, and will also be of interest to more advanced students and researchers in philosophy, economics, political theory, public policy, and public health.",,Routledge,Essays,Philosophy,,104525,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FnAKBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,77.5,GoogleBooks

Wells's The Invisible Man is a riveting exploration of science's power to corrupt With his face swaddled in bandages, his eyes hidden behind dark glasses and his hands covered even indoors, Griffin - the new guest at The Coach and Horses - Is at first assumed to be a shy accident-victim. But the true reason for his disguise is far more chilling: he has developed a process that has made him invisible, and is locked in a struggle to discover the antidote. Forced from the village and driven to murder, he seeks the aid of his old friend Kemp. The horror of his fate has affected his mind, however - and when Kemp refuses to help, Griffin resolves to wreak his revenge. This edition includes a full biographical essay on Wells, a further reading list and detailed notes on the text.

Born in Ulm, Germany, in 1879, he is most famous for his theory of relativity. He also made enormous contributions to quantum mechanics and cosmology, and for his work he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1921. A self-pronounced pacifist, humanist, and, late in his life, democratic socialist, Einstein was also deeply concerned with the social impact of his discoveries. Much of Einstein's life is shrouded in legend. From popular images and advertisements to various works of theater and fiction, he has come to signify so many things. In Einstein: A Biography, Jürgen Neffe presents a clear and probing portrait of the man behind the myth. Unearthing new documents, including a series of previously unknown letters from Einstein to his sons, which shed new light on his role as a father, Neffe paints a rich portrait of the tumultuous years in which Einstein lived and worked. And with a background in the sciences, he describes and contextualizes Einstein's enormous contributions to our scientific legacy. Einstein, a breakout bestseller in Germany, is sure to be a classic biography of the man and proverbial genius who has been called ""the brain of the [twentieth] century.""",Eastern Press,"Farrar, Straus and Giroux",Science,Biography & Autobiography,Hardback,101271,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=B8K6n177ZwcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,76.92,GoogleBooks

Human beings have a deep-seated instinct for cruelty, and, so far, have not evolved much past it. History is rife with examples of the infliction of pain used as penalty or execution. In The History of Torture, Daniel P. Mannix takes you from the crucifixions of ancient Rome, to the hanging of women during the Salem witch trials, to the atrocities discovered at Nazi concentration camps. The act of torture has shifted from simple barbarism to advanced psychological techniques thanks to science and technology. Now it’s not just an actual flogging that will have a prisoner spilling his guts, but law enforcement’s coercive tactics that might prompt a confession. Follow Mannix as he: leads you into the chambers of Inquisitors, who elevated torture to an art form; illuminates the myriad miseries of the slave trade, America’s greatest contribution to the torture hall of fame; and explains the most terrible and famous of all Chinese tortures, the Ling-chez or “death of a thousand cuts.” No country or culture is spared in this wide-reaching survey of suffering.",AAP,Open Road Media,Torture,Social Science,Paperback,102150,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=liY7EQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,76.92,GoogleBooks

Andrei is a model Soviet citizen, a swaggeringly self-satisfied mogul of the food industry who intends to revolutionize modern life with mass-produced sausage. Nikolai is a loser. Finding him drunk in the gutter, Andrei gives him a bed for the night and a job as a gofer. Nikolai takes what he can, but that doesn't mean he's grateful. Griping, sulking, grovelingly abject, he despises everything Andrei believes in, even if he envies him his every breath. Producer and sponger, insider and outcast, master and man fight back and forth in the pages of Olesha's anarchic comedy. It is a contest of wills in which nothing is sure except the incorrigible human heart.

His clear and engaging prose style makes this two-volume work accessible to both scholars and general readers interested in the history of ideas. Lecky's work is situated within the context of the 19th-century historiography, drawing on a wealth of primary sources and engaging with the philosophical debates of his time. Through his nuanced examination of rationalism, Lecky offers valuable insights into the evolution of European thought. William Edward Hartpole Lecky, a renowned historian and philosopher, was influenced by the intellectual currents of his time, particularly the secularization of society and the growing emphasis on reason. His meticulous research and insightful analysis are evident throughout the 'History of the Rise and Influence of the Spirit of Rationalism in Europe', demonstrating his deep understanding of the complex interplay between ideas and historical events. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the intellectual history of Europe and the development of rational thought. Lecky's work remains a vital contribution to the study of rationalism and its enduring impact on Western civilization.","Longmans, Green, and Co.",Good Press,Rationalism / History,Religion,Hardback,101943,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7zbmEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,76.56,GoogleBooks

This compelling work weaves together historical narratives with detailed analyses of ecclesiastical texts, illuminating the fervent conflicts between orthodox Christianity and various dissenting movements. Turberville'Äôs prose is characterized by clarity and precision, allowing readers to navigate the complexities of medieval thought while he meticulously unpacks how heretical beliefs challenged the church's authority and the resultant mechanisms of the Inquisition meant to suppress them. The book's scholarly approach situates it firmly within the broader context of medieval studies and religious history, making it an invaluable resource for understanding how heresy was perceived and addressed during this tumultuous period. Turberville himself was deeply influenced by the intellectual currents of his time, as well as by the legacies of earlier historians exploring the tensions between faith and reason. His profound interest in the intersection of social power and religious belief led him to delve into the dark aspects of medieval ecclesiastical power and its impact on societal norms, paving the way for his critical insights in this work. I highly recommend ""Medi√¶val Heresy & the Inquisition"" to scholars, students, and anyone interested in the intricate dynamics of faith and ideology in medieval Europe.

Acts of persecution are somewhat loosely said to be done “in the name of” religion. The only accurate form of the proposition is that they are done by religion as the moving spirit and by the church as the interpreter of religion, “in the name of” Jesus Christ, or some other prophet, or of the deity acknowledged by the persecutors. This aspect of the truth has not before been set forth and proved by citation of facts. No other book contains between its covers so full an account of the offenses against humanity which have owed their inspiration to religion. Protestants have written books to show the persecuting spirit of Catholicism, and Catholics have done the same disservice to Protestantism.

White began to assemble his magnum opus, a two volume work first published in 1896 as A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom. In correspondence he wrote that he intended the work to stake out a position between such religious orthodoxy as John Henry Newman's on one side and such secular scoffing as Robert Ingersoll's on the other. Historian Paul Carter declared that this book did as much as any other published work ""toward routing orthodoxy in the name of science."" Insofar as science and religion came to be widely viewed as enemies, with science holding the moral high ground, White inadvertently, became one of the most effective and influential advocates for unbelief.""--Provided by publisher.",D.

At once a mathematician, philosopher, theologian, physicist, and engineer, Pascal’s discoveries, experiments, and theories helped usher in a modern world of scientific thought and methodology. In this singular book on this singular genius, distinguished scholar Mary Ann Caws explores the rich contributions of this extraordinary thinker, interweaving his writings and discoveries with an account of his life and career and the wider intellectual world of his time. Caws takes us back to Pascal’s youth, when he was a child prodigy first engaging mathematics through the works of mathematicians such as Father Mersenne. She describes his early scientific experiments and his construction of mechanical calculating machines; she looks at his correspondence with important thinkers such as René Descartes and Pierre de Fermat; she surveys his many inventions, such as the first means of public transportation in Paris; and she considers his later religious exaltations in works such as the “Memorial.” Along the way, Caws examines Pascal’s various modes of writing—whether he is arguing with the strict puritanical modes of church politics, assuming the personality of a naïve provincial trying to understand the Jesuitical approach, offering pithy aphorisms in the Pensées, or meditating on thinking about thinking itself. Altogether, this book lays side by side many aspects of Pascal’s life and work that are seldom found in a single volume: his religious motivations and faith, his scientific passions, and his practical savvy. The result is a comprehensive but easily approachable account of a fascinating and influential figure.",Published with the Editorial advice of the faculties of the University of Chicago,Reaktion Books,,Biography & Autobiography,,102325,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=T746EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,75.08,GoogleBooks

Indeed, Darwin praised Chambers daring, calling his book an excellent service that had swept away prejudice and prepared the public for introduction to Darwins similar ideas, for Chambers anticipated Darwin with his discussions of: the geological formation of the earth hypotheses on the development of the plant and animal kingdoms the early history of mankind and much more.

With breathtaking command of medieval Muslim sources as well as the vast literature on medieval European and Muslim culture, Carole Hillenbrand has produced a book that shows not only how the Crusades were perceived by the Muslims, but how the Crusades affected the Muslim world - militarily, culturally, and psychologically. As the author demonstrates, that influence continues now, centuries after the events. In The Crusades the reader discovers how the Muslims reacted to the Franks, and how Muslim populations were displaced, the ensuing period of jihad, the careers of Nur al-Din and Saladin, and the interpenetration of Muslim and Christian cultures. Stereotypes of the Franks in Muslim documents offer a fascinating counter to Western views of the infidel of legend. For readers interested in the Middle Ages, military history, the history of religion, and postcolonial studies, The Crusades opens a window onto a conflict we have only viewed from one side. The Crusades is richly illustrated, with eighteen color plates and over five hundred line drawings and black and white photographs.",Secker & Warburg,Psychology Press,History / Crusades,History,Hardback,102685,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UalnoF5MBHMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,75,GoogleBooks

Wilmot-Buxton's 'The Story of the Crusades' is an engaging historical account that vividly recaptures the fervor, dynamics, and saga of the medieval crusades. Crafted in a narrative style that bridges the gap between scholarly detail and compelling storytelling, it contextualizes the intersection of faith, conviction, and martial ardor that propelled Christian knights towards the Holy Land. Wilmot-Buxton gives life to iconic figures such as Bohemond and Richard the Lionheart, while intricately tracing the rise of Islamic power and the eventual waning of Christendom's crusading spirit with the fall of Constantinople. The book embodies a literary style that balances a passion for medieval virtues with an understanding of the complexity of historical events, making the chronicles accessible without sacrificing depth.

This is my task. I must conjure, procure and invent, as a novelty is only novel once and no success succeeds as surely as failure fails. ' London 1879 - In a gloomy room on Islington's backstreets showman Percy Unusual George dreams of the miracle that will change his fortunes and that of his troupe of performing Remarkables. This waking dream will lead him to an infamous French dwarf, an exiled Polish king, and a superstar of the Enlightenment... and alter the course of his life forever. France 1746-1764 - At the court of Lunéville, in the Alsace region of Lorraine, exiled Polish King Stanislas hosts grand parties for the French nobility and luminaries of the Enlightenment. While Voltaire dotes on his lover, Émilie du Châtelet, the Polish king presents his horrified queen with a gift of an infant dwarf from the Vosges Mountains. King Stanislas names the child Bébé, and watches indulgently as his protégé becomes the most notorious and celebrated dwarf in France, until an unexpected guest arrives and unforeseen tragedy follows. Two ambitious men. One hundred years apart. Kitty Aldridge entwines their stories to powerful effect in this astonishingly imaginative and daring novel. The Wisdom of Bones is a high-wire performance: a hypnotic tale of desire and ambition, a quest for celebrity, and the human ache to be loved and remembered.

Pentecostalism has 600 million followers; by 2050, they’ll be one in ten people worldwide. This is the religion of the Holy Spirit, with believers directly experiencing God and His blessings: success for the mind, body, spirit and wallet. Pentecostalism is a social movement. It serves impoverished people in Africa and Latin America, and inspires anti-establishment leaders from Trump to Bolsonaro. In Australia, Europe and Korea, it throws itself into culture wars and social media, offering meaning and community to the rootless and marginalised in a fragmenting world. Reporting this revolution from twelve countries and six US states, Elle Hardy weaves a timeless tale of miracles, money and power, set in our volatile age of extremes. By turns troubling and entertaining, Beyond Belief exposes the Pentecostal agenda: not just saving souls, but transforming societies and controlling politics.

Pusey,St Augustine,1907,2007-10-01,,"9780802480675, 0802480675",,305,,"""Augustine never thought of God without thinking of his sin, nor of his sin without thinking of Christ."" St. Augustine grates hard against ""the anatomy of evil"" while dealing succinctly and honestly with his own proneness toward sin. From his infatuation with its initial beauty to the discounting of his previously wasted life, Augustine leaves little to the imagination regarding his need to be saved from himself. Most of Augustine's Confessions are spent in a nearly catastrophe tug of war. From insult and injury to passion, lost love, and the arts--this work leads through and beyond a world where God's timing is absolutely perfect. Nothing has really changed since then. Sin is still sin--and God is still God. Moody Classics Of all the factors influencing our spiritual growth and development, pivotal books play a key role. Learning from those who have walked the path and fought the fight brings wisdom and strengthens resolve. And hearing the familiar chords of kingdom living sung by voices from other times can penetrate cultural barriers that limit our allegiance to the King. To this end, Moody Publishers is honored to introduce the first six volumes in what is to be an ongoing series of spiritual classics. Selected for their enduring influence and timeless perspective, these new editions promise to shape the lives of spiritual pilgrims for generations to come.",,Moody Publishers,Catholicism,Biography & Autobiography,,103457,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Uc2JTTW9vaMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,72.58,GoogleBooks

But what does 'fundamentalism' really mean? Since it was coined by American Protestant evangelicals in the 1920s, the word has expanded its meaning to include radical conservatives or ideological purists in many spheres of activity, not all of them religious. Modern applications of fundamentalism include Islamist radicals in the Muslim world, the militant Israeli settlers who oppose them as well as Sikh, Hindu and even Buddhist nationalists who seek to justify their political agendas by reference to divine edicts or religious tradition.

After young sailors began suddenly dying with mysterious symptoms, Lieutenant Colonel Stewart Alexander, a doctor and chemical weapons expert, was dispatched to investigate. He quickly diagnosed mustard gas exposure, which Churchill denied. Undaunted, Alexander defied British officials and persevered with his investigation.

Non Christian Cross,The Non-christian Cross,Denham Parsons,John Denham Parsons,1896,2017-02,,"1542847907, 9781542847902",,114,,"The history of the symbol of the cross has had an attraction for the author ever since, as an enquiring youth, he found himself unable to obtain satisfactory answers to four questions concerning the same which presented themselves to his mind. The first of those questions was why John the Baptist, who was beheaded before Jesus was executed, and so far as we are told never had anything to do with a cross, is represented in our religious pictures as holding a cross. The second question was whether this curious but perhaps in itself easily explained practice had in its inception any connection with the non-Mosaic initiatory rite of baptism; which Jesus accepted as a matter of course at the hands of his cousin John, and in which the sign of the cross has for ages been the all-important feature. And it was the wonder whether there was or was not some association between the facts that the New Testament writers give no explanation whatever of the origin of baptism as an initiatory rite, that this non-Mosaic initiatory rite was in use among Sun-God worshippers long before our era, and that the Fathers admitted that the followers of the Persian conception of the Sun-God marked their initiates upon the forehead like the followers of the Christ, which finally induced the author to start a systematic enquiry into the history of the cross as a symbol. The third question was why, despite the fact that the instrument of execution to which Jesus was affixed can have had but one shape, almost any kind of cross is accepted as a symbol of our faith. The last of the four questions was why many varieties of the cross of four equal arms, which certainly was not a representation of an instrument of execution, were accepted by Christians as symbols of the Christ before any cross which could possibly have been a representation of an instrument of execution was given a place among the symbols of Christianity; while even nowadays one variety of the cross of four equal arms is the favourite symbol of the Greek Church, and both it and the other varieties enter into the ornamentation of our sacred properties and dispute the supremacy with the cross which has one of its arms longer than the other three. Pursuing these matters for himself, the author eventually found that even before our era the cross was venerated by many as the symbol of Life; though our works of reference seldom mention this fact, and never do it justice. He moreover discovered that no one has ever written a complete history of the symbol, showing the possibility that the stauros or post to which Jesus was affixed was not cross-shaped, and the certainty that, in any case, what eventually became the symbol of our faith owed some of its prestige as a Christian symbol of Victory and Life to the position it occupied in pre-Christian days. The author has therefore, in the hope of drawing attention to the subject, incorporated the results of his researches in the present essay. 14, ST.

Jesus of Nazareth,Jesus of Nazareth,Edward Clodd,Gerald L. Borchert,1905,2011,,"9780881462661, 0881462667",119,277,,"Jesus of Nazareth is a comprehensive introduction to Jesus and the gospels for college and seminary students. It begins with discussions on communication and patterns of reading the Bible before detailing the historical setting, the geographical, social and religious contexts during the time of Jesus, such as the language and community aspects, and the rabbinic, literary and institutional settings that were present. Next, Borchert discusses the nature of the gospels before each gospel witness is treated individually to identify the particular uniqueness of the portrait of Jesus that is being presented by each author. The non-canonical portraits of Jesus are also introduced in order to help readers understand the struggles, which emerged in the early church. Finally, the significance of Jesus who is the focus of the gospels is presented. After reviewing the time issues for Jesus, theological concerns related to Jesus are considered such as: the virginal conception and the incarnation, the issues of temptation and sin, the relationship of Jesus to God and the messianic consciousness of Jesus, the crucial issues of the death and resurrection of the Messiah, and the Church¿s expectation of the return of Jesus in power. This important theological section concludes with discussions on the integrity of our understanding of Jesus and the very sensitive nature of proof as compared to the nature of belief. Borchert weighs these matters fairly, bearing in mind his own presuppositions. He closes the work with suggested implications of this study in terms of doubt and rejection on the one hand and worship as well as living and witnessing to and for Jesus on the other. Written with clarity and erudition, this accessible introduction reflects a life-time of both classroom and church experience in the teaching the Gospels.",Watts & Co,Mercer University Press,Jesus,Religion,Hardback,100819,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=04NVdAHU6mAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,70.83,GoogleBooks

Vivian Green has the knack of telling an intricate, ever-changing story of vast historical sweep and a large cast of characters, with clarity, simplicity, and literary grace. In 11 chapters, Green covers 20 centuries from the youthful Christian community, with its intrinsically Jewish origins, to the vast multifaceted institution on the verge of the Third Millennium. Particularly noteworthy is the attention devoted to the present condition of the Christian movement. Green studies the pontificate of John Paul II, the status of religion in post-Communist Russia and Eastern Europe, the rise of televangelism and neo-Fundamentalism, and the crisis of changing moral values. He also examines the ordination of women, the exponential growth of Christianity in Africa and its decline in the Northern Hemisphere, and the ferment in Latin America.",,,Christianity,Christianity,,101422,,Lending,,70.83,GoogleBooks

This was the most sensational archeological find in the UK since Piltdown Man - only this time it was not a hoax. Continuing excavation by site archeologist Mark Roberts has enabled him and his team to build up a picture of this, the first Englishman, and to open up a unique window on life in Britain before the Ice Age. Because these human remains, the artefacts surrounding them and the remains of the local flora and fauna - including elephants and rhinoceroses of an extinct species - are preserved in an unprecedented way, we now discover how our ancestors hunted, ate, manufactured the implements they needed to survive and interacted; these were neither the opportunist scavengers nor the mindless killers that they have previously been supposed to be.

What the Bible really Says,What the Bible Really Says?,Morton Smith,Thomas A. Howe,1989,2009-01-01,,"9781498275637, 149827563X",,208,,"The study of the End Times has been a popular topic for many years, and there are many different positions that are proposed on how to understand the unfolding of God's program. The debate over the End Times has often been heated and has failed to showcase the best that Christian scholarship has to offer. It sometimes seems like everyone wants to get in on the action, and anyone who has an audience can (and has) put together his thoughts and made his opinions known through the printed page. Anyone can publish his views regardless of the level of competency in the original languages, his level of hermeneutic ability, or his understanding of history or theology. In his book The Apocalypse Code, Hank Hanegraaff declares that his goal is to ""put hermeneutical tools into your hands so that you can draw from Scripture what God intends you to understand rather than uncritically accepting end-time models that may well be foreign to the text."" It would be extremely helpful for someone to equip readers to be able to make their way through the maze of views. What the Bible Really Says? is a point-by-point analysis of the arguments of Hank Hanegraaff concerning end-times prophecy. This book is not an effort to promote one eschatological perspective over another. Rather it is an analysis of Hanegraaff's arguments and claims in order to discover whether or not he has succeeded in putting hermeneutical tools into the hands of his readers, or whether he has simply added his voice and his opinions to the cacophony of claims and counterclaims.",,Wipf and Stock Publishers,Bible,Religion,,103694,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rULkDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,70.03,GoogleBooks

God chose to create man doubly complex. He made man of both soul and body a spiritual reality and a material reality. To crown this complexity, He created them male and female. Dr. von Hildebrand elucidates the tragic separation that happened with original sin and the consequences of this brokenness in the world today: the distortion of the male and female genius, supernatural blindness, and the triumph of secularism. She explores how this brokenness can be healed by following God s Divine plan for man and woman. We see this first and foremost in our Blessed Mother, exemplar of the path to holiness. This is also seen in the characteristics of saintly male / female relationships between husbands and wives, fathers and daughters, mothers and sons, brothers and sisters, and holy friendships.

The third of Dostoevsky's five major novels, it is at once a powerful political tract and a profound study of atheism, depicting the disarray which follows the appearance of a band of modish radicals in a small provincial town. Dostoevsky compares infectious radicalism to the devils that drove the Gadarene swine over the precipice in his vision of a society possessed by demonic creatures that produce devastating delusions of rationality. Dostoevsky is at his most imaginatively humorous in Devils: the novel is full of buffoonery and grotesque comedy. The plot is loosely based on the details of a notorious case of political murder, but Dostoevsky weaves suicide, rape, and a multiplicity of scandals into a compelling story of political evil. This new translation also includes the chapter `Stavrogin's Confession', which was initially considered to be too shocking to print.

Ingersollia,Ingersollia,Thomas Handford,Robert Green Ingersoll,1899,2022-08-15,,EAN:8596547172338,322,307,,"In Ingersollia, readers encounter a meticulous compilation of the profound reflections extracted from the lectures, speeches, and dialogues of Robert Green Ingersoll, the illustrious orator known for his progressive views and rhetorical prowess. The work is a trove of philosophical and humanistic thought, resonating with Ingersoll's commitment to secularism and rationality. Through an eloquent literary style, the text provides an insightful and reflective lens on 19th-century America, subtly advocating for social reform and intellectual freedom. This edition, fashioned with the attention to the conservation of historical discourse, presents these 'Gems of Thought' in a polished contemporary format, skillfully bridging the gap between past wisdom and present-day contemplation. Robert Green Ingersoll, sometimes hailed as 'The Great Agnostic,' was a prominent lawyer, politician, and intellectual figure who offered a commanding voice against the orthodoxies of the time and promoted free thought. It is this fervent spirit to question, debate, and explore that permeated his works. His experiences as a Civil War veteran and public speaker influenced his ideas greatly, leading him to write on diverse topics, from religion and science to human rights and literature. Ingersollia encapsulates the essence of his belief system, and the prose within captures his remarkable intellect and articulate expressions that have motivated generations to pursue truth and knowledge unencumbered by dogma. This edition of Ingersollia is a commendable acquisition for both historical scholars and contemporary thinkers. It invokes a profound appreciation for Ingersoll's articulate advocacy and undoubted influence upon the realms of philosophy, religion, and politics. For those intrigued by the dynamics of human thought and the eternal struggle between tradition and innovation, Ingersoll's work offers a stimulative exploration of these themes, serving as a beacon for readers to navigate the complex waters of moral and intellectual liberty. The modern reader will find in these pages not only the timeless eloquence of Ingersoll's convictions but also an enduring inspiration to engage with the world with an enlightened and unyielding perspective.",M.A Donohue,DigiCat,Essays,Fiction,Paperback,104229,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nYiCEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,68.33,GoogleBooks

If the resurrection really occurred, of what importance is it to you and me?

Yet Thomas Miller, an experienced scientist and well-respected surgeon, challenges the notion that modern medicine has disproved the possibility of the resurrection. Through careful investigation of the evidence and evaluation of its reliability, Dr. Miller demonstrates that science and religion are not incompatible and makes a compelling case for the reality of the resurrection.",W Stewart,Wipf and Stock Publishers,Jesus,Religion,Hardback,104409,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=exltEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,67.5,GoogleBooks

In the latter opinion I was confirmed by many expressions in Dean Stanley's widely-read works; especially the following: - It is now twenty-seven years since Arnold wrote to Bunsen 'What Wolf and Niebuhr have done for Greece and Rome, seems sadly wanted for Judea.' The wish thus boldly expressed for a critical and historical investigation of the Jewish history was, in fact, already on the eve of accomplishment. At that time Ewald was only known as one of the chief Orientalists of Germany. He had not yet proved himself to be the first Biblical scholar in Europe. But year by year he was advancing towards his grand object. To his profound knowledge of the Hebrew language he added, step by step, a knowledge of each stage of the Hebrew literature.

The Vatican has remained one of the last unexamined mysteries of the modern world. For centuries, pomp and pageantry have hidden from view the dramatic, sometimes sinister, realities that haunt the office of Supreme Pontiff and the men who make up his papacy. Gordon Thomas and Max Morgan Witts now bring their tremendous investigative talent to this most secret of institutions, offering us an unrivaled portrait and day-to-day account of the lives, personalities, and relationships of the three most recent popes: an equally fine account of the hour-by-hour deliberations of the closely guarded conclaves at which two popes were elected in the fateful year of 1978; and a remarkable rendering of the concrete issues facing the institutional papacy—in foreign affairs, economic matters, and the human factor—the highly individual ambitions, loyalties, and hatreds that characterize the men and women who serve the Holy Father. The result is a book that is ahead of the world’s headlines, a book that makes headlines of its own. Not only have the authors brought the world of the Vatican into the open, their sleuthing has uncovered several major news stories. Pontiff includes a day-to-day account of the assassination attempt by Mehmet Ali Agca upon John Paul II: Agca’s history and family, his right-wing political connections, his activities and jailing in Turkey, his escape from jail aided by the KGB, his movements through terrorist training camps in Libya and Syria, and a complete investigation of the Bulgarian connection that led to the shooting in St. Peter’s Square. Here, also, is the story of John Paul II’s involvement with the creation of Solidarity in Poland, and his almost-daily secret contacts with Lech Walesa, as well as the unprecedented letter to Brezhev threatening his resignation from the papal throne. In addition, owing to the authors’ intricate web of connections at the Vatican (including many cardinals), the book contains previously unknown information about the man entrusted with the Church’s money, Paul Marcinkus, and his relationship with the shadowy Michele Sindona. Pontiff is a fascinating revelation of a world previously unknown to us, and an intimate view of a few men in Rome trying to lead an increasingly unwilling world to their own vision of salvation.",,Open Road Media,Catholic / Vatican,Religion,,103799,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pZS4AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,65.38,GoogleBooks

Eschewing the traditional model for histories of this kind – blow-by-blow political narratives typically overloaded with detail - Jeremy Black offers us instead a brilliant thematic account of the last 100 years with the environment and the continuing strength of religious belief at its centre. Looking back to the 1910s and 1920s, Black begins with ""the greatest issue of all"" – the natural environment and its destruction, and moves to show how our world been transformed by urbanisation and development. Amazing developments took place across the century: men walked on the moon, the internet revolutionised communications; advances in health and medicine; developments in manufacturing and technology; economic globalization – all have changed the way different parts of the world related to each other. How have these revolutionary changes impacted on religion and politics? In the final sections of the book, Black looks at the persistence and growing extremism in religious belief, how change creates instability and wars, and how power blocs emerged and collapsed in response to all these developments. This is twentieth century world history on a truly global scale. The Twentieth Century World forces us to rethink the way we view the past, and offers us a new way to understand the present.",,Routledge,Religion,History,,102191,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=V5WPCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,64.45,GoogleBooks

Ehrman vigorously defends the historical Jesus, identifies the most historically reliable sources for best understanding Jesus’ mission and message, and offers a compelling portrait of the person at the heart of the Christian tradition. Known as a master explainer with deep knowledge of the field, Bart Ehrman methodically demolishes both the scholarly and popular “mythicist” arguments against the existence of Jesus. Marshaling evidence from within the Bible and the wider historical record of the ancient world, Ehrman tackles the key issues that surround the mythologies associated with Jesus and the early Christian movement. In Did Jesus Exist?: The Historical Argument for Jesus of Nazareth, Ehrman establishes the criterion for any genuine historical investigation and provides a robust defense of the methods required to discover the Jesus of history.",Pemberton Books,Harper Collins,Jesus,Religion,,104443,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hf5Rj8EtsPkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,62.5,GoogleBooks

This belief was not without its grounds. The preparations of both the combatants were in every department in the last state of perfection; and he could see the rest of the Hellenic race taking sides in the quarrel; those who delayed doing so at once having it in contemplation. Indeed this was the greatest movement yet known in history, not only of the Hellenes, but of a large part of the barbarian world-I had almost said of mankind. For though the events of remote antiquity, and even those that more immediately preceded the war, could not from lapse of time be clearly ascertained, yet the evidences which an inquiry carried as far back as was practicable leads me to trust, all point to the conclusion that there was nothing on a great scale, either in war or in other matters.",Encyclopedia Brittanica,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,Ancient History,,Hardback,101545,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2wCsvQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,62.01,GoogleBooks

Using the commentaries of a group of scholars from c. 1150-1350, such as Peter Lombard, Robert Grosseteste, and Bonaventure, along with confessors’ manuals, mystery plays and sermon material, this book investigates the place of the Decalogue in medieval thought. Beginning with the overarching themes of law and number, it moves to consider what sort of God is revealed in the commandments of the first stone tablet, and uncovers the structure that lay behind the precepts dealing with one’s neighbour.

Three biographical essays are also included: two new ones by Sharon Presley and Crispin Sartwell, and a rarely reprinted one from Emma Goldman. At a time when the mainstream women's movement asked only for the right to vote and rarely challenged the status quo, de Cleyre demanded an end to sex roles, called for economic independence for women, autonomy within and without marriage, and offered a radical critique of the role of the Church and State in oppressing women. In today's world of anti-globalization actions, de Cleyre's anarchist ideals of local self-rule, individual conscience, and decentralization of power still remain fresh and relevant.",,State University of New York Press,Feminism,Social Science,,103106,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WW5zfinjzMwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,61.11,GoogleBooks

That which appears may not be and that which lies hidden might just be the stark, naked face of reality. Rahul had everything going his way – a soaring career, a happy family and all else a man his age could yearn for. And then suddenly his life began to crumble all around him, disintegrating element after precious element, leaving him to watch in helpless horror. Where had he gone wrong? Was there still hope for redemption, even a solitary ray that he could cling on to? Avantika, a pretty, vivacious girl who had come into Rahul’s life by pure accident, literally, has suddenly gone missing. Just like that, without as much as a trace. Where is Avantika? Will Rahul be able to find her? Is it her own past that has come back to consume her or is it something even more vicious and sinister? Shalini, Rahul’s first love and a girl accustomed to leading life on her own terms. Hailing from a family that exerts considerable influence in the galleries of politics and power, she certainly has the wherewithal to impact a lot of things. Even lives. Is Shalini fostering a grudge that could displace not one but many lives? Could she be the one behind Avantika’s mysterious disappearance?

Join renowned neuroscientist David Eagleman for a journey into the questions at the heart of our existence. What is reality? Who are 'you'? How do you make decisions? Why does your brain need other people? How is technology poised to change what it means to be human? In the course of his investigations, Eagleman guides us through the world of extreme sports, criminal justice, facial expressions, genocide, brain surgery, gut feelings, robotics, and the search for immortality.

Interpretation of the Sophists benefits from the recent reevaluation of their thought. Socrates himself would be inconceivable without the Sophists since he is one of them. Socrates is given major prominence. Plato, Aristotle, and all of Hellenistic philosophy are deeply impregnated with his words and spirit. The teachings of the Minor Socratics are interpreted as one-sided reductions of the pluralistic values of Socratic thought and as anticipations of some issues that explode later in the Hellenistic Age. There are two appendices. The first concerns Orphism and contains a series of documents indispensable for the comprehension of some aspects of pre-Socratic and Platonic thought.

Is evolution compatible with traditional religion? Does time exist or is it just our way of ordering experiences? Could a machine ever think? What do scientists really mean when they call something a fact?’ Modern science has unravelled the mystery of life, seen back to the dawn of time and peered down into the weird world of quantum mechanics. Small wonder then that people now look to science to answer the big metaphysical questions. In Falling for Science Bernard Beckett shows this instinct to be misguided. According to Beckett, the modern fashion for making scientists ‘the High Priests of Everything’ is mysticism in a lab coat. Here the author argues for a new model of scepticism, one which leaves scientists and story tellers to each get on with what they’re best at. Beckett is a powerful, persuasive communicator who writes in the contemporary vein of popular science writers like Matt Ridley, Steven Pinker and Jared Diamond. With wit and not a little irreverence, Beckett offers a history of the ideas behind recent scientific development, and introduces the reader to arguments about the nature of consciousness, evolutionary biology, artificial intelligence – and more.

Superior Men,A Superior Man,H Johnson,Paul Yee,1949,2015-10-19,,"9781551525914, 1551525917",,248,Book of Reason,"For more than thirty years, Paul Yee has written about his Chinese-Canadian heritage in award-winning books for young readers as well as adult non-fiction. Here, in his first work of fiction for adults, he takes us on a harrowing journey into a milestone event of Canadian history: the use of Chinese coolies to help build the Canadian Pacific Railway in British Columbia in hazardous conditions. After the CPR is built in 1885, Yang Hok, a former coolie, treks along the railway to return his half-Chinese/half-Native son to the boy's mother where he confronts the conflicts arising from road-building among the Chinese and Native peoples. Hok's guide on the often perilous trip, Sam Bing Lew, also of mixed Chinese-Native blood, urges Hok to take his son to China, while Hok has dreams of finding fortune in America. The two men agree on little, as many issues fester between Chinese and Natives at a time when both races were disdained as inferior by whites (""redbeards""). This far-reaching novel crackles with the brutal, visceral energy of the time—a period marked by contraband, illegal gambling, disfigurement, and death. It also depicts the bawdy world of Chinese ""bachelors,"" whose families remained in China while they worked in Canada, and who enjoyed more freedom to live their lives without restraint. Yang Hok is not an easy man to like; but through the blood and sweat of his experience, he aspires to become the ""superior man"" he knows he should be. Boldly frank and steeped in history, A Superior Man paints a vivid portrait of the experience of the Chinese in North America in the 19th century. Paul Yee's twenty-seven books for young people include the Governor General's Award-winning Ghost Train. This is his first novel for adults.",,arsenal pulp press,Rationalism,Fiction,,101765,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SK42DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,56.25,GoogleBooks

Now the spotlight falls on the Old Testament's perspective on the life that Israel should live in its present and future, including its worship, prayer and spirituality, as well as its practices, attitudes and ethics before God. Goldingay sees three spheres of life giving order to Israel's vision: its life in relation to God, its life in community and the life of the individual as a self. Within these frameworks he unfurls a tapesetry that is as broad and colorful as all of life, and yet detailed in its intricate attention to the text. With this final volume John Goldingay has given us the third pillar of an Old Testament theology that is monumental in scope and yet invites us to enter through multiple doors to explore its riches. Students will profit from a semester in its courts, and ministers of the Word will find their preaching and teaching deeply enriched by wandering its halls and meditating in its chambers.",SCM Press Ltd,InterVarsity Press,Theology,Religion,,106479,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9TYi_qm6iJwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,55.5,GoogleBooks

The Science of Materialism,The Science of Monads,Charles Sprading,Mike Hockney,1942,,,,,429,,"Scientific materialism isn't the only type of science. Leibniz, the great German genius, was a champion of scientific idealism. The atoms in his system weren't physical, but mental, and he named them monads. A present-day Leibniz might say, ""All things are made from mental atoms, which are simple mathematical substances from which all compounds are mathematically derived via the laws of ontological mathematics. Monads are expressed through constant motion, and that mental motion is what we call thinking. Pure thinking takes place in an immaterial, mathematical frequency domain outside space and time. By virtue of Fourier mathematics, frequency functions can be represented in a spacetime domain, and this domain is what is known as the physical world of matter. It is just a certain mode of mental functionality. There is no such thing as scientific matter. There is only mind. A mind is a monad, and monads are all there are. Everything is an expression of monadic, mental mathematics.""",,Magus Books,,Philosophy,,102759,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZgbzEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,55.05,GoogleBooks

But it’s us: we’re finite beings. Faith recognizes our limits; it acknowledges life’s ambiguity. And it counters these with its understanding of what is most true—God.

In The Twentieth Century: A World History, R. Keith Schoppa uses a global lens spanning Africa, the Middle East, Russia, Asia and the Pacific, Europe, and the Americas. He traces the major developments of the twentieth century from the rise of globalization to the dawn of the digital age; from the Great War of 1914-18 to the ""great war in Africa,"" conflicts that span the first genocide of the century in Namibia to that of Bosnia-Kosovo in the late 1990s. It was the ""century of the refugee,"" as the explosion of human violence caused significant population displacement-and it was also the century of indigenous peoples fighting off the lingering impacts of imperialism. This volume surveys various U.S. struggles in battles for civil rights, and witnesses the 1992 collapse of Soviet communism. The century ended in a spasm of violence: four African and European national genocides and the African war, one of the ten deadliest in history, involving nine nations, leaving 6 million dead and 5.4 million refugees. From the collapse of empires to the rise of decolonized nation-states on the global stage, The Twentieth Century: A World History offers a rich chronological narrative of our recent past and provides a valuable historical standpoint from which to view our twenty-first century world.",George Allen & Unwin,Oxford University Press,Science/History,History,,103856,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aX0_EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,54.46,GoogleBooks

Judas is the voice within us that will not be put to rest with platitudes nor silenced with sensible palliatives for nonsensical pain. Where human love, even self love, turns away with regret, or even disgust, divine love persists and prevails as the amazing grace of God. It is of this grace that I write, of Judas and of the healing of the deep wounds to his soul.

Beginning with Mary Shadd Cary’s demands for equal rights for women and blacks in the 1850s and ending with Indigenous women’s achievement of the vote in the 1960s, Sangster travels back in time to tell a new, more inclusive story for a new generation. The history of the vote, as Joan Sangster tells it, offers vital insights into our political life, exposing not only the fissures of inequality that cut deep into our country’s past but also their weaknesses in the face of resistance, optimism, and protest – an inspiring legacy that still resonates to this day.",Elek Books,UBC Press,Freethought,History,Hardback,103815,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AdZMDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,53.91,GoogleBooks

For most people the word conjures up a great deal of pictures or thoughts that run the ambit of fanatics running the streets with tracts in their hands to the nice little Christian who models their faith through a quiet lifestyle. Is either of these correct? Is the answer somewhere in the middle? Is there a correct answer at all? I believe that there is. This book is designed to walk one through the ministry principles and actions of the greatest evangelist of all times, Jesus Christ. He remains the best example of communicating the good news in a purposeful, personal, progressive, practical, and pervasive manner. The steps to an effective witness are in following pillar principles demonstrated by Jesus. The confidence to be involved in evangelism is tied to following the pillar principles of evangelism. The understanding of what to say, how to say it and when to say it are found in the pillar principles of evangelism demonstrated by Jesus and are explained in this book.

There's a revolution going on and (however unconsciously) we're all already part of it. Welcome to the New Realism. The charms of the global and virtual future we were all brought up to expect, where meals would be eaten in the form of pills and machines would do all our work, have worn rather thin. It's not that we don't want all the advantages of progress - we do - we just want a future that manages to be local and real too. Tracking the struggle for reality from Japanese theme parks to mock-Tudor villas and from Byron to Big Brother, this book explains where our reactions against spin and fakeness come from - and where they are going.

The present edition contains a translation of and extensive commentary on the text of the longer of the two, chapter 39, with a hieroglyphic transcription of six representative manuscripts from the 18th Dynasty down to the Ptolemaic period. Apopis, the rebel against cosmic order, is traditionally represented as a giant serpent and documented in a great number of cosmological and ritual texts of the Middle Kingdom and later. He is the ever-returning opponent of the sun god Re', trying to halt the course of the sun boat. His emerging from the chaos waters is especially feared at night. Although time and again the attack is repelled and Apopis driven back or bound and annihilated by the sun god's helpers, he always resurges and continues to be a threat to the cosmic balance. Precisely this is the theme of chapter 39, which is less a description of events than a violent vociferation on the part of gods and goddesses against the enemy. An attempt is made in the commentary to reconstruct the course of events.",Kegan Paul Trench & Trubner,Otto Harrassowitz Verlag,Ancient Egypt,Foreign Language Study,Hardback,106435,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7ycN-6bACRwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,52.98,GoogleBooks

Wheeler delivers a compendious exploration of the lives and thoughts of prominent freethinkers throughout history. The book is meticulously organized, offering readers a wealth of biographical information alongside critical analyses of each figure's contributions to philosophy, science, and social reform. Wheeler'Äôs literary style is both accessible and erudite, seamlessly blending biographical narrative with thematic discussions that situate these individuals within their cultural and intellectual contexts. This work serves not only as a reference but also as a reflective journey through the evolution of freethought across diverse civilizations and epochs. J. M. Wheeler, a noted scholar in the fields of philosophy and social history, draws upon a meticulous academic background and a personal commitment to rational inquiry in crafting this dictionary. His extensive research into the lives of freethinkers reflects his belief in the transformative power of reason and individual thought, which has shaped his scholarly pursuits. This volume is a culmination of years of exploration into marginalized voices that contributed significantly to intellectual discourse, despite often facing societal backlash. I highly recommend ""A Biographical Dictionary of Freethinkers of All Ages and Nations"" to anyone interested in understanding the complex interplay between reason, belief, and societal progress.

They ask themselves questions such as, ""What do we need to change in order to keep up with a wired world?"" ""What should never change?"" ""What are the nonnegotiables of faith in Jesus?"" Many have attempted to answer these questions. However, most of these leaders offer solutions that the everyday ministry leader simply cannot replicate. Signs of the Times is a unique offering to those who wrestle with the mash-up of ministry and culture. All of the contributors have found success within their ministries, and yet most do not minister to thousands on a weekly basis.

Aslaksen who continues to develop the view of society and its evolution published in earlier work – The Social Bond (Springer 2018), The Stability of Society (Springer 2020), and Measures of Social Evolution (Springer 2021), bringing together core material of that work with the results of recent investigations in order to present the evolution of society as an integrated and continuous story leading right up to the present time. A story of human action driven by our beliefs, desires, and an ideology arising out of our ability to transform and exploit our environment through the development and application of technology. The distinguishing feature of the work is the treatment of society as an information-processing system and applying the system methodology for handling complexity, as it is applied, e.g., in engineering. This focus on information is particularly pertinent in the current circumstances, where the world has arrived at a critical point in its history through the conjunction of a number of issues that appear to be spiralling out of control: Global warming and the associated climate change, the destruction of our environment through such processes as land clearing and industrialisation with associated loss of biodiversity, the rapidly increasing visibility of the inequality in the quality of life with associated tensions, and above all, the determination of the US-led Western alliance to cling to its hegemonial role, apparently at all cost. With the sophistication and proliferation of nuclear weapons, the latter has the potential to bring on the end of civilisation as we know it. The resolution of any of these issues depends on the information available to all parties involved, and hence, the availability and quality of information is seen as the crucial and overarching issue of the present time. A number of aspects of this issue, including the role of education, economic inequality, and the control of the media, are treated in some detail, and proposals for some small steps in the right direction are put forward.",Watts & Co,Springer,Sociology,Technology & Engineering,Hardback,100617,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=u3GCzwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,50,GoogleBooks

Written in a candid and provocative style, this work is infused with Strindberg's characteristic psychological depth and realism, as he delves into themes of gender conflict and existential angst. The novel'Äôs fragmented structure and stream-of-consciousness narrative create an immersive experience, reflecting the chaotic nature of human emotions and the societal constraints of the late 19th century. Strindberg, a prominent figure in modern drama, was profoundly influenced by his tumultuous personal life, marked by failed marriages and conflicting ideologies about gender. His experiences provided a rich backdrop for 'ÄúMarried,'Äù as he explored the dissonance between romantic ideals and the harsh realities of marriage, shedding light on the deeply ingrained cultural norms of his time. His engagement with themes of power dynamics in relationships illustrates his broader philosophical inquiries into human nature and societal roles. For readers drawn to psychological exploration and social critique, ""Married"" offers an unflinching examination of the human condition. Strindberg'Äôs keen observations and eloquent prose make this novel a compelling read, inviting reflection on the nature of love and the complexities of human connection.

Harrison Christian and the mutineers of Men Without Country held me happily captive to the very last page.’ Dava Sobel, author of Longitude A mission to collect breadfruit from Tahiti becomes the most famous mutiny in history when the crew rise up against Captain William Bligh, with accusations of food restrictions and unfair punishments. Bligh’s remarkable journey back to safety is well documented, but the fates of the mutinous men remain shrouded in mystery. Some settled in Tahiti only to face capture and court martial, others sailed on to form a secret colony on Pitcairn Island, the most remote inhabited island on earth, avoiding detection for twenty years. When an American captain stumbled across the island in 1808, only one of the Bounty mutineers was left alive. Told by a direct descendant of Fletcher Christian, Men Without Country details the journey of the Bounty, and the lives of the men aboard. Lives dominated by a punishing regime of hard work and scarce rations, and deeply divided by the hierarchy of class. It is a tale of adventure and exploration punctuated by moments of extreme violence – towards each other and the people of the South Pacific. For the first time, Christian provides a comprehensive and compelling account of the whole story – from the history of trade and exploration in the South Seas to Pitcairn Island, which provided the mutineers’ salvation, and then became their grave. Praise for Men Without Country ‘Men Without Country shows what a writer can produce when he has real skin in the game ... Harrison Christian sets the record straight on the Bounty mutiny with forensic fervour, including the before, the during – and the after.’ – Adam Courtenay, author of The Ship that Never Was ‘Full of quirky detail, hair-raising descriptions of ocean voyages and memorable characterisations, Men Without Country is an absolute ripper of a tale, an old story that new questions make relevant and fresh.’ – The Saturday Paper ‘Written by a descendant of Christian, this is an unvarnished, unbiased, account of the mutiny and its aftermath on Pitcairn, putting it in its broader historical context.

Harrison Christian and the mutineers of Men Without Country held me happily captive to the very last page.’ Dava Sobel, author of Longitude A mission to collect breadfruit from Tahiti becomes the most famous mutiny in history when the crew rise up against Captain William Bligh, with accusations of food restrictions and unfair punishments. Bligh’s remarkable journey back to safety is well documented, but the fates of the mutinous men remain shrouded in mystery. Some settled in Tahiti only to face capture and court martial, others sailed on to form a secret colony on Pitcairn Island, the most remote inhabited island on earth, avoiding detection for twenty years. When an American captain stumbled across the island in 1808, only one of the Bounty mutineers was left alive. Told by a direct descendant of Fletcher Christian, Men Without Country details the journey of the Bounty, and the lives of the men aboard. Lives dominated by a punishing regime of hard work and scarce rations, and deeply divided by the hierarchy of class. It is a tale of adventure and exploration punctuated by moments of extreme violence – towards each other and the people of the South Pacific. For the first time, Christian provides a comprehensive and compelling account of the whole story – from the history of trade and exploration in the South Seas to Pitcairn Island, which provided the mutineers’ salvation, and then became their grave. Praise for Men Without Country ‘Men Without Country shows what a writer can produce when he has real skin in the game ... Harrison Christian sets the record straight on the Bounty mutiny with forensic fervour, including the before, the during – and the after.’ – Adam Courtenay, author of The Ship that Never Was ‘Full of quirky detail, hair-raising descriptions of ocean voyages and memorable characterisations, Men Without Country is an absolute ripper of a tale, an old story that new questions make relevant and fresh.’ – The Saturday Paper ‘Written by a descendant of Christian, this is an unvarnished, unbiased, account of the mutiny and its aftermath on Pitcairn, putting it in its broader historical context. Rich in detail, but easy to read, this is a great retelling of the tale.’ – Daily Telegraph​ ‘In his highly readable book, Harrison Christian captures something of [Fletcher Christian’s] elusive personality, but also the terror of the mutineers’ precarious existence on Pitcairn and the brutal end that awaited many of them.’ – The Listener ‘This is both a journalistic investigation, using primary and secondary sources, and a personal journey, the author being a direct relative of the mutiny’s leader, Fletcher Christian.’ – Sydney Morning Herald",Watts & Co,Hardie Grant Publishing,Humanism,History,Hardback,101508,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=w5sjEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,48.8,GoogleBooks

Karl Marx Early Writings,Early Writings,B Bottomore,Karl Marx,1963,1992-07,,"9780140445749, 0140445749",,700,,"Written in 1833-4, when Marx was barely twenty-five, this astonishingly rich body of works formed the cornerstone for his later political philosophy. In the Critique of Hegel's Doctrine of the State, he dissects Hegel's thought and develops his own views on civil society, while his Letters reveal a furious intellect struggling to develop the egalitarian theory of state. Equally challenging are his controversial essay On the Jewish Question and the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts, where Marx first made clear his views on alienation, the state, democracy and human nature. Brilliantly insightful, Marx's Early Writings reveal a mind on the brink of one of the most revolutionary ideas in human history - the theory of Communism. This translation fully conveys the vigour of the original works. The introduction, by Lucio Colletti, considers the beliefs of the young Marx and explores these writings in the light of the later development of Marxism.

He argues that an understanding of justification rooted in pragmatism leads to practical principles that apply to all those we would recognize as persons. The account bears implications for the nature of selfhood, the freedom of the will, the meaning of moral terms, the power of moral principles to motivate, conceptions of truth, the nature of value, and the use and abuse of abstract moral theorizing. Rationalist Pragmatism develops its pragmatically informed morality in light of prominent ethical schools, as well as relevant topics in the philosophy of language, metaphysics, and epistemology, including the correspondence theory of truth, inferentialist semantics, motivational internalism, the source of value, and experimental philosophy. Finally, Silver explores concrete moral and political implications of his theory, demonstrating that metaethics can affect positions regarding the morality of personal relations; the treatment of animals; and political assessments of democracy, socialism, and nationalism. Silver maintains that our interest in truth—our rational nature as practical and theoretical beings—forms us as a community of mutually recognizing truth seekers.",,Rowman & Littlefield,Rationalism,Philosophy,,102824,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=82fuDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,47.06,GoogleBooks

The book's revelations of clericalism, hypocrisy, cover-ups and widespread homosexuality in the highest echelons of the Vatican provoked questions that the most senior Vatican officials--and the Pope himself--were forced to act upon; it would go on to become a New York Times bestseller. Now, almost a year after the book's first publication, Frédéric Martel reflects in a new foreword on the effect the book has had and the events that have come to light since it was first released. In the Closet of the Vatican describes the double lives of priests--including the cardinals living with their young ""assistants"" in luxurious apartments whilst professing humility and chastity--the cover-up of numerous cases of sexual abuse; sinister scheming in the Vatican; political conspiracy overseas in Argentina and Chile, and the resignation of Benedict XVI. From his unique position as a respected journalist with uninhibited access to some of the Vatican's most influential people and private spaces, Martel presents a shattering account of a system rotten to its very core.",Barters Handbooks,Bloomsbury Publishing,Catholicism,Religion,Hardback,102816,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JPWGDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,46.67,GoogleBooks
Objective Reality,Purely Objective Reality,G. Roberts,John Deely,1925,2009-09-04,,"9781934078099, 1934078093",,228,,"In his 'Letter on Humanism' of 1947, Heidegger declared that the subject/object opposition and the terminology that accrues to it had still not been properly addressed in the history of philosophy, and he awaited a proper disquisition that resolved the problem. To date, that has not been provided. This volume explains and solves the prevailing problems in the subjectivity/objectivity couplet, in the process making an indispensable contribution both to semiotics and to philosophy. This book shows that what is thought to be 'objective' in the commonplace use of the term is demonstrably different from what objectivity entails when it is revealed by semiotic analysis. It demonstrates in its exegesis of the 'objective' that human existence is frequently governed by examples of a 'purely objective reality' – a fiction which nevertheless perfuses, is perfused by, and guides experience. The ontology of the sign can be mind-dependent or mind-independent, just as the status of relation can be as legitimate on its own terms whether it is found in ens rationis or in ens reale. The difference in the awareness of human animals consists in this very contextualization that Deely's writings in general have made so evident: the ability to identify signs as sign relations, and the ability to enact relations on a mind-dependent basis. Purely Objective Reality offers the first sustained and theoretically consistent interrogation of the means by which human understanding of 'reality' will be instrumental in the survival – or destruction – of planet Earth.",,Walter de Gruyter,,Language Arts & Disciplines,,102870,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ul5DOsNiuhQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,46.62,GoogleBooks

Each of these treaties was concluded between the Principal Allied and Associated Powers (consisting of the United States of America, the British Empire, France, Italy and Japan) on the one hand, and one of the Central Powers like Germany, Turkey or Bulgaria. One of the terms of such treaties required conversion of all of the Central Powers’ military and armaments related production and related facilities into purely commercial use. The decision and the modus operandi to ensure this rested with a Military Inter-Allied Commission of Control. The Military Inter-Allied Commission of Control was also entrusted with a number of other responsibilities, including (a) setting the number of customs officials, local urban and rural police, forest guards and other officials under the control of the Government of the central power concerned; and (b) receiving information relating to the location of the stocks and depots of arms, munitions and war material and their operations. It was during this period of 1919-1923 that Brig.-Gen. Morgan witnessed German attempts to build up their army contravening the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, and he published his findings in October 1924 in the Quarterly Review, titled “The Disarmament of Germany and After.” However, it would not be until after World War II that he would decide to elaborate on this theme—the result is the present volume, Assize of Arms: The Disarmament of Germany and Her Rearmament (1919-1939). First published in 1945, it was intended to be published in two volumes; however, owing to Brig.-Gen. Morgan’s passing in 1955, it remained as a single volume.

They are not contemporary if viewed from the perspective of the religion's practioners (in religious and non-religious settings). The textbooks that attempt to be interesting to undergraduate students often fall short because they either try to cover too much in an encyclopedic format, or sacrifice a sociological perspective for a personal one. Many use real-life examples only superficially to illustrate concepts. Lundskow's approach is the opposite—students will learn the facts of religion in its great diversity, all the most interesting and compelling beliefs and practices, and then learn relevant concepts that can be used to explain empirical observations. The book thus follows the logic of actual research—investigate and then analyze—rather than approaching concepts with no real bearing on how religion is experienced in society. This approach, using provocative examples and with an eye toward the historical and theoretical, not to mention global experience of religion, will make this book a success in the classroom. The author envisions a substantive approach that examines religion as it actually exists in all its forms, including belief, ritual, daily living, identity, institutions, social movements, social control, and social change. Within these broad categories, the book will devote particular chapters to important historical moments and movements, leaders, and various individual religions that have shaped the contemporary form and effect of religion in the world today.",Basil Blackwell,SAGE Publications,Sociology / Religion,Social Science,Hardback,100422,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5AV1AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,44.99,GoogleBooks

Drawing on detailed interview and ethnographic material gathered in the UK, this book examines the ways in which a form of secularism - ’non-Islamiosity’ - amongst members of the Iranian diaspora shapes ideas and practices of diasporic community and identity, as well as wider social relations. In addition to developing a novel theoretical paradigm to make sense of the manner in which diasporic communities construct and live diasporic identity and consciousness in a way that marginalises, stigmatises or eradicates only ’Islam’, Secularism and Identity shows how this approach is used to overcome religiously inculcated ideas and fashion a desirable self, thus creating a new space in which to live and thereby attaining ’freedom’. Calling into question notions of anti-Islamism and Islamophobia, whilst examining secularism as a means or mechanism rather than an end, this volume offers a new understanding of religion as a marker of migrant identity. As such it will appeal to scholars of sociology, anthropology and political science with interests in migration and ethnicity, diasporic communities, the sociology of religion and emerging forms of secularism.",Human-Etisk Forbund,Routledge,Secularism / Norway,Religion,Paperback,104690,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=M_-qCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,44.58,GoogleBooks

Evolution is the most important idea in biology, with implications that go far beyond science.

Now, for the first time in a book aimed at a general audience, one of the founding fathers of modern biology tells us what we know - and what we do not know - about evolution. In showing how evolution has gone from theory to fact, he explores various controversial fads and fallacies such as punctuated equilibrium, the selfish-gene theory and evolutionary psychology.

Family break downs,oppression of women,war, terrorism, John visits them all, a fun fact collection of stories","Is faith delusion? Is religion bad for your health? How, in a scientifically and technologically advanced age, can people still believe in God/spirit/'other'? Clearly not all believers are primitive and ill-educated; an alternative explanation is that they must be mad, or at least severely neurotic (as suggested by Freud). This book starts by looking at, and giving reasons for, the connection and the division between Christian faith and psychiatry. It asks whether science challenges Christians involved with psychiatry, as patients or professionals, and whether the spiritual needs of patients are recognised. The author examines the scope and use of the neuro-sciences and considers cause and effect, natural selection and determinism. He explores the overlap (and the difference) between psychiatric symptoms and religious belief, the possible association between demon possession and mental illness, and the idea that some people are intrinsically religious and some are not. The variations of personality are examined, with their implications for belief. Posited as a statement, that faith is delusion is always hostile, but outcome studies (reviewed here) show that in general religious belief and practice convey good mental health. Religious faith and mental illness are different, and their concepts come from different world-views. A consideration of them in relation to each other is long overdue. The author is a former Professor of Psychiatry and President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, and has also been Chairman of their Spirituality and Psychiatry Special Interest Group, so is exceptionally well qualified to address the subject.

Published originally in two volumes in 1890, this extraordinary study of primitive myth and magic led Scottish anthropologist J.G. Frazer to identify parallel patterns of ritual, symbols and belief across many centuries and many different cultures. His observations on the mysteries of fertility and death, and the rites of the sacrificial king who must die to save his people, overturned much of contemporary intellectual thinking, not least because of the enlightening or ‘heretical’ parallels it suggested with the Christian religion. Frazer’s elegant and authoritative style, and the breadth of his learning inspired a whole generation of ethnographers and comparative anthropologists, and had a particularly powerful effect on many other thinkers and writers such as Sigmund Freud, D.H. Lawrence, Joyce, Yeats and T.S. Eliot. This definitive volume includes the unabridged original 1890 edition as well as several essays and lectures by Frazer. ‘Frazer’s work has epic scale yet mesmerizing fineness of detail.

How can we relate to the Holy God and the Judge? Why is a God of love called the “Jealous God?” What does it mean to call Jesus the Messiah?

Two rival visions clash. One seeks a single way of explaining everything known and knowable about ourselves and the universe. The other champions diverse modes of understanding served by disparate kinds of evidence. Contrary views pit science against the arts and humanities. Scientists generally laud and seek convergence. Artists and humanists deplore amalgamation as a threat to humane values. These opposing perspectives flamed into hostility in the 1950s ""Two Cultures"" clash. They culminate today in new efforts to conjoin insights into physical nature and human culture, and new fears lest such syntheses submerge what the arts and humanities most value. This book, stemming from David Lowenthal’s inaugural Stockholm Archipelago Lectures, explores the Two Cultures quarrel’s underlying ideologies. Lowenthal shows how ingrained bias toward unity or diversity shapes major issues in education, religion, genetics, race relations, heritage governance, and environmental policy. Aimed at a general academic audience, Quest for the Unity of Knowledge especially targets those in conservation, ecology, history of ideas, museology, and heritage studies.",,Routledge,,Design,,104475,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hZV2DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,43.57,GoogleBooks

Scholars, citing the medieval origins of the term, have often portrayed Russian Christianity as uniquely muddied by paganism, with 'double-believing' Christians consciously or unconsciously preserving pagan traditions even into the twentieth century. This volume shows how the concept of dvoeverie arose with nineteenth-century scholars obsessed with the Russian 'folk' and was perpetuated as a propaganda tool in the Soviet period, colouring our perception of both popular faith in Russian and medieval Russian culture for over a century. It surveys the wide variety of uses of the term from the eleventh to the seventeenth century, and contrasts them to its use in modern historiography, concluding that our modern interpretation of dvoeverie would not have been recognized by medieval clerics, and that 'double-belief' is a modern academic construct. Furthermore, it offers a brief foray into medieval Orthodoxy via the mind of the believer, through the language and literature of the period.",Paravision Books,Routledge,Catholicism / Russia,History,,104292,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Au82QC1EVPgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,43.45,GoogleBooks

The Will To Civilization,The Life Cycle of Civilizations,Bernard Katz,Stephen Blaha,1938,2002,,"9780972079587, 0972079580",,213,An inquiry into the principles of historic change,"This book is an expanded version of The Rhythms of History, the book that made macro-History into a semi-quantitative Science. New features include: 1. an appendix showing how the history of Mayan civilization conforms to the book''s Theory of Civilizations including the latest information from the newly discovered hieroglyphic texts at Dos Pilas, Guatemala; 2. an appendix on the sub-Saharan African civilization, Great Zimbabwe, showing it fits the theory; 3. a comparison of the theory with Toynbee''s observations showing the many new features resulting from a quantitative theory; 4. numerous historic pictures and illustrations of the civilizations of Mankind including a number of newly found pictures from the nineteenth century; 5. a chapter describing the potentially disturbing implications of patterns in civilizations - Are we free? ? and the implications for the Philosophy of History; and 6. expanded comments in many sections such as the sections on the future of Humanity, the role of China, and the Islamic - West conflict. The book begins with a hard hitting, ""tell it like it is"" chapter on the current international situation with statements such as: ""The United States and Western civilization is now engaged in a small Vietnam-style war on a global scale at the time of this writing. This war is still in the early stages of development. ... The attack on the World Trade Center by Muslim terrorists may have the same significance for Western civilization that the Gothic invasion of Rome itself in the prime of the Empire (the First Century AD) had for the future of Rome. They may be a premonition of things to come - not necessarily soon but perhaps in a few centuries. The Goths returned three centuries later and remained as permanent conquerors. ... Over the long term the West must free itself from a dependence on Muslim oil. Muslim oil revenues are the fuel for the development of weapons of mass destruction by Iran and Iraq. In the future they will supply the revenues of an expansionist Islam. ... As the silk trade looted the Roman Empire of its gold and reduced its economy, the trade in oil is looting the West of its prosperity and freedom of action. The rise and fall of oil prices has a significantly greater effect on the American and world economy than the raising and lowering of interest rates by central banks. "" The book then describes a theory of civilizations that led to these observations. Currently unfolding events seem to be fulfilling the predictions which were made last year (including the new North Korean threat that seems to be consistent with a predicted breakdown in Japan ? North Korea will create major problems with Japan. As this is being written Japan is moving Aegis destroyers nearer to North Korea and preparing for defense.) THE EVENTS DESCRIBED IN THIS BOOK, AND ITS PREDECESSOR, APPEAR TO BE HAPPENING AS PREDICTED LAST YEAR. According to Theory of Civilizations the basis of civilizations was laid with a genetic mutation (found by Ding et al) 40,000 years ago that created bold enterprising individuals who became the leadership group of civilizations: a group that Toynbee called the ""creative minority."" When the world''s climate became warmer and more stable 10,000 years ago the seeds of civilizations began to germinate. Thus the origin of civilizations is tied to human genetics. The book then shows that a long-term social behavior pattern of mankind (based on four generation trends) causes civilizations to develop and ""oscillate"" in patterns of routs and rallies. Civilizations rise and fall due to their internal human dynamics. The theory of civilization is developed using equations and 68 diagrams that show a close detailed match between the theory and the actual history of all known Asian, European and African civilizations over the last 5,500 years. The theory projects the future of today''s civilizations (including the future of Western and Islamic civilizations). It also successfully describes the interaction of barbarians and civilizations, the interaction of two civilizations, the impact of modern technology on civilizations (it accounts for the Luddite reaction to the Industrial Revolution), the impact of major environmental events on civilizations (e.g. the collapse of Minoan civilization due to a volcanic eruption), and the disintegration of civilizations. It also accounts for the tremendous growth phases seen in many civilizations such as the building of the great pyramids in Egyptian civilizations. Based on the theory fifteen new civilizations are identified including new prehistoric Chinese and Egyptian civilizations. Having shown the success of the theory for earth civilizations it considers the form of extraterrestrial civilizations and calculates their impact on Western civilization should contact be established. The book also shows the need for the colonization of space and nearby planets if mankind is to progress in the future. The book analyzes the impact of the lengthening life spans of mankind on the future of civilizations. Predictions are made for the ""state of the world"" for 2050 and 2100. A detailed understanding the past enables the theory of civilizations to make predictions for the future. Defining Progress to be the sum of the world''s civilizations the book shows that Progress seems to be approximately linearly increasing over the last 5,500 years. A plot of Progress appears on the book''s cover (shown on this web page) together with the contributions of each civilization to Progress. (The vertical order of the civilizations in the plot is arbitrary. Older civilizations tend to be lower in the plot.) The book is a tour de force that makes History a Science rather than a collection of random events. It is the first detailed mathematical treatment of history. Although the book contains mathematics it is intended for the general reader as well as the mathematically inclined. There are copious verbal descriptions of the theory as well as many figures plotting the theory versus historical events. A qualitative, descriptive theory of civilizations is also presented that is like a ""Dow Theory of Civilizations.""",Martin Secker & Warburg Ltd,Pingree-Hill Publishing,Theology,Civilization,,101841,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3a9mlWP2uFAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,42.71,GoogleBooks

Linked stories, or stories that form a story cycle, are a common book-length form seen in Asian American literature that accommodates multiple perspectives across generations and locations. Through this story cycle, patterns emerge as cultural identity and individuality, often in tension with one another, shape choices and outcomes. With these stories, Carol Roh Spaulding charts shifting definitions of “Americanness” across time through the arc of a family narrative. She also explores desire and belonging as articulated, in turns, by the mother, father, granddaughter, great-grandson, and even a ghost child who died after a tragic accident. But these linked stories center on the life experiences of Gracie Song. They follow her from girlhood to young motherhood, through her children’s teenage years, and finally to her elderly solitude, when to her great astonishment she finds romance with a younger man and reconciliation with an estranged daughter—both unexpected gifts of later life.",Roma,University of Georgia Press,Poetry,Fiction,Paperback,101309,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gzraEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,42.63,GoogleBooks

If we have the eyes to see and the ears to hear, we will notice God everywhere. In this beautiful book, Cloud helps us see, listen, and open to the all-consuming love God pours out to us.” (Phileena Heuertz, author of Pilgrimage of a Soul: Contemplative Spirituality for the Active Life and founding partner, Gravity, a Center for Contemplative Activism) “How did Alexander Hamilton overcome a tragic and shame-filled childhood? Kevin Cloud celebrates the amazing grace that propelled Hamilton to become a key architect of our fledgling democracy. For all who struggle with doubt, depression, and despair, God and Hamilton offers an inspiring way forward. Kevin Cloud’s book made my heart sing!” (Craig Detweiler, President, The Seattle School of Theology and Psychology) “C.S. Lewis once lamented that people too often fail to appreciate the real and serious glory of even the most dull and uninteresting human life; that if we could ever truly glimpse the beauty of a normal everyday person’s story we might actually be tempted to worship them. In God and Hamilton, Kevin Cloud offers precisely this kind of appreciative glimpse into the life of Alexander Hamilton. These pastoral reflections upon a life that was anything but dull and uninteresting are sure to inspire. Read this book and catch a new imagination for what it means to be human.” (Tim Suttle, pastor and author of Shrink: Faithful Ministry in a Church-Growth Culture) A Note from the Author: I will never forget the moment I saw Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Hamilton: An American Musical on Broadway. I walked out of the Richard Rogers Theatre that night knowing that I had seen a ground-breaking and brilliant Broadway musical. I also knew that Hamilton somehow become for me a deeply spiritual experience. I soon discovered that I was not the only one. I read so many reviews and watched so many interviews where people spoke of Hamilton as a life changing experience. Rosie O’Donnell even went so far as to call it “medicine that I need for my soul. It is vital to me; it feels like going to church.” In writing this book, I have come to see Hamilton as a story that will transform our lives. A story that teaches us about grace, shame, forgiveness, and despair. A story that invites us into the struggle for equality and challenges us to partner with God in his ultimate goal of bringing redemption to His creation. I pray that this story, which intersects insights from the musical, the lives of Alexander and Eliza Hamilton, and the story of Scripture, might transform your life as well.",Beacon Press,Deep River Books,Catholicism,Young Adult Fiction,Hardback,100520,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-wHtDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,42.57,GoogleBooks

Encyclopedia Biblica (Vol 2),Encyclopedia of Biblical Literature,J S (edt) & Black Thomas K Cheyne,"Kitto, John",1899,,,,NaN,2436,,"This Encyclopedia of Biblical Literature is a 6 volume set in 1 book. It has over 2,300 entries and more than 300 illustrations. It also has a linked table of contents and a full word index at the end of the volume. This Encyclopedia was designed to furnish a Dictionary of the Bible, not framed, as others had been, out of old materials, but embodying the products of the best and most recent researches in Biblical Literature, in which the scholars of this country and of the continent had been engaged. That work—the result of an immense labor and research, and enriched by the contributions of writers of distinguished eminence in the various departments of Sacred Literature—has been, by universal consent, pronounced to be the first work of its class, and the one best suited to the advanced knowledge of the present day, in all the studies connected with Theological Science. But although that Encyclopedia is regarded as indispensable to the libraries of all Ministers and Theological Students, it has been concluded that a Compendious Abridgment of its contents, embracing all the matter suited to popular and general use, might be acceptable to very many whose studies have not created a need for the larger work, or whose means do not enable them to secure the possession of it. In the present volume an attempt has, therefore, been made to supply this want, by providing such a popular Abridgment of the Encyclopedia of Biblical Literature as may be suited to the use of the great body of the religious public, and which may be expected to be of essential service to parents and teachers in the important business of Biblical Education, while to many young persons it may serve as an introduction to the more extensive work. The original publication is above twice the size of the present. The Epitome now offered for popular use has been prepared with much care and solicitude, by the condensation of most of the matter in the original work, and by the entire omission of some articles which were supposed to be of less interest to the general reader than to the Clergyman and the Theological Student. In the work, as it here stands, is offered such an exhibition of the results of large research, without the details and authorities, as could not, it is believed, have been produced, had not the larger Encyclopedia previously existed, and its valuable materials been made available for this service. Drawn from such a source, it is believed that this Abridgment will possess the same superiority over Popular Encyclopedias of this class, as the original work confessedly does over those which aspire to higher erudition. In the Encyclopedia of Biblical Literature the initials of the writers are annexed to their respective contributions.

Many articles in the larger Encyclopedia, more especially in the department of Natural History, are treated under the Hebrew or Greek form of a word: but, in the present popular Compendium, it has been judged better that these articles should appear under the names by which they are represented in the authorized version of the Scriptures, and take their place in the alphabetical position they hold under these names.

Lederberg was motivated not by a displaced libido, but by scientific ambition. At the age of seven, he had declared that he hoped to become 'like Einstein' and to 'discover a few things in science.' The 'few things' Lederberg discovered would revolutionise modern science and earn him a Nobel Prize. He chose to observe the breeding habits of a certain bacterium called Escherichia coli, better known as E coli. His experiments used defective E coli strains lacking the essential molecules to reproduce by cloning which should, by rights, perish in the petri dish. But slowly, a few colonies of survivors began to spread accross the dishes. The only possible explanation for their survival was that they were a product of sex. Not only had Lederberg proved that bacteria have sex, he had also proved they have genes. Since then, a bacterium that was once nothing more than a humble resident of the human gut has become our best guide to what it means to be alive. Most of us might only know E coli for its lethal strain that causes food poisoning, but Zimmer uses E coli as a prism to understand what life is, what it was, and what it will become. We learn how E coli microbes talk to each other, how studies of their evolution represent the most powerful evidence in support of natural selection, and how they might just explain life on other planets...",,Random House,Science,Science,,104129,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EpL-pE1ZHKEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,41.46,GoogleBooks

The Secular promise Of Liberty & Equality: Revisiting Rawls on Freedom of Belief.,The Secular Conscience,Quaine Wallace,Austin Dacey,2013,2008,,UOM:39015076143695,,288,a different perspective on freedom of belief,"From Washington to the Vatican to Tehran, religion is a public matter as never before, and secular values -- individual autonomy, pluralism, separation of religion and state, and freedom of conscience -- are attacked on all sides and defended by few. The godly claim a monopoly on the language of morality, while secular liberals stand accused of standing for nothing. Secular liberals did not lose their moral compass: they gave it away. For generations, too many have insisted that questions of conscience -- religion, ethics, and values -- are ""private matters"" that have no place in public debate. Ironically, this ideology hinders them from subjecting religion to due scrutiny when it encroaches on individual rights and from unabashedly advocating their own moral vision in politics for fear of ""imposing"" their beliefs on others. In his incisive new book, philosopher Austin Dacey calls for a bold rethinking of the nature of conscience and its role in public life. Inspired by an earlier liberal tradition that he traces to Spinoza and John Stuart Mill, Dacey urges liberals to lift their self-imposed gag order and defend a renewed secularism based on the objective moral value of conscience. Dacey compares conscience to the press in an open society: it is protected from coercion and control, not because it is private, but because it has a vital role in the public sphere. It is free, but not liberated from shared standards of truth and right. It must come before any and all faiths, for it is what tells us whether or not to believe. In this way, conscience supplies a shared vocabulary for meaningful dialogue in a diverse society, and an ethical lingua franca in which to address the world.",N.Z.

When the conditions are right, they ignite, and they burn with such fierce intensity that they outshine all their rivals. From 1890 and through the early years of the 20th century, Vienna became a dazzling beacon. The city was powered by an unprecedented number of extraordinary people - artists Klimt and Schiele, thinkers such as Theodor Herzl, and fashion icons like the glamorous Empress Sisi. Conversations in coffee houses and salons spurred advances in almost every area of human endeavour: science, politics, philosophy, and the arts. The influence of early 20th century Vienna is still detectable all around us - but the place where it is at its strongest is in our heads. The way we think about ourselves has been largely determined by Vienna's most celebrated resident: Sigmund Freud.

You may not be mentioned by name, but you are included there. End-times prophecies speak of faithful followers of Jesus—called the “remnant”—who are ready for the last days and His return, but they also speak of those who are unprepared or fall away before His appearing. Which prophecy will you fulfill? Jesus Is Coming Soon: Discern the End-Time Signs and Prepare for His Return will help you be certain you are part of God’s remnant. The signs of the end of the age and Jesus’s appearing are evident in the physical and spiritual worlds. But most people, including Christians, have not recognized them. What signs has God given to announce the culmination of His purposes for the world? How can we discern them? How can we prepare? This book will unfold: The reason for the unprecedented natural and spiritual shakings in our world What the signs tell us, including unusual signs such as blood moons How God works according to seasons, eras, and the fullness of time How Jewish feasts point to the ages of man, accurately showing us God’s time clock Which imminent biblical signs and promises have yet to be fulfilled The judgments God is bringing to the earth God has given prophecies concerning Israel, the church, and the world. And His Spirit is disclosing His last-days purposes right now. We need to know how to receive the vital revelation and prophetic knowledge He wants to share with His people. When we have this foreknowledge, we can understand the times and prepare for His final plans for the earth. God intends the church to be a community of hope, revival, and supernatural power in the midst of dark times. There is a spirit of confusion in the world today. People must turn to God for the answers only He can give, and the church needs to be ready to provide those answers. In these end times, you do not need to be fearful, discouraged, or distracted. Instead, you can know your true position in God before Christ’s appearing. You can be joyfully prepared, watching and waiting in expectation, with your spiritual eyes open.

It is prized by historians since it provides the best narrative material for the reigns of Tiberius, Claudius, and Nero, as well as a probing analysis of the imperial system of government. But the Annals should be seen as far more than an historical source, a mere mine for the reconstruction of the facts of Roman history. While the Annals is a superb work of history, it has also become a central text in the western literary, political, and even philosophical traditions - from the Renaissance to the French and American revolutions, and beyond. This volume attempts to enhance the reader's understanding of how this book of history could have such a profound effect.Chapters will address the purpose, form, and method of Roman historical writing, the ethnic biases of Tacitus, and his use of sources. Since Tacitus has been regarded as one of the first analysts of the psychopathology of political life, the book will examine the emperors, the women of the court, and the ambitious entourage of freedmen and intellectuals who surround every Roman ruler. The final chapter will examine the impact of Tacitus' Annals since their rediscovery by Boccaccio in the 14th century.",,Oxford University Press,,History,,101087,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5Hk8DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,38.84,GoogleBooks

The Wizard of Oz (1900) introduces Dorothy, who arrives from Kansas and meets the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, the Cowardly Lion, and a host of other characters. The Emerald City of Oz (1910) finds Dorothy, Aunt Em, and Uncle Henry coming to Oz just as the wicked Nome King is plotting to conquer its people. In Baum's final novel, Glinda of Oz (1920), Dorothy and Princess Ozma try to prevent a battle between the Skeezers and the Flatheads. Tapping into a deeply rooted desire in himself and his loyal readers to live in a peaceful country which values the sharing of talents and gifts, Baum's imaginative creation, like all great utopian literature, holds out the possibility for change.

Freemasonry and the Anti Christian Movement,Freemasonry and Rudolf Steiner,E (Rev) Cahill,N.V.P Franklin,1959,2020-10-16,,"9781912230556, 1912230550",271,349,,"Today some six million Freemasons around the world continue to perform their rituals regularly – an enormous legacy of spiritual endeavour, kept largely in secret. In Britain alone there are over 7,000 lodges, with a quarter of a million members. What is this wealth, this appeal, and how did the philosopher and spiritual scientist Rudolf Steiner reinterpret or reconstruct Freemasonry’s time-worn legacy? Unless one is a Freemason, the masonic world, with its arcane conventions and language, remains largely unknown: an obscurity that is almost impossible to fathom. Yet understanding its traditions and style are invaluable when approaching Goethe, Mozart, Herder, Lessing and Novalis – as well as Rudolf Steiner. Steiner himself renewed the ‘Royal Art’ of Freemasonry from 1906 to 1914 through his ritual work known as Mystica Æterna. When Steiner invigorated education, medicine, the social order and religion, he fully intended that committed and professional individuals should assume responsibility for the new initiatives. But this was not the case with the Masonic Order he founded, whose leadership he took upon himself. Even the celebration of his passing in 1925, led by Marie Steiner, was entirely Masonic in character. In the context of continuing resistance and misrepresentation, N.V.P. Franklin uncovers the living heart of Freemasonry and reveals why it was – and still is – immensely relevant to anthroposophy. With profound research into its older rituals and teachings, this detailed and conscientious study is a unique contribution to comprehending freemasonry and anthroposophy – both historically and in the present day.",M H Gill,Temple Lodge Publishing,Freemasonry / Christianity,Religion,Hardback,100673,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=G_MFEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,38.41,GoogleBooks

Stigler,1993,1990-03-01,,"9780674256859, 0674256859",,436,,"This magnificent book is the first comprehensive history of statistics from its beginnings around 1700 to its emergence as a distinct and mature discipline around 1900. Stephen M. Stigler shows how statistics arose from the interplay of mathematical concepts and the needs of several applied sciences including astronomy, geodesy, experimental psychology, genetics, and sociology. He addresses many intriguing questions: How did scientists learn to combine measurements made under different conditions? And how were they led to use probability theory to measure the accuracy of the result? Why were statistical methods used successfully in astronomy long before they began to play a significant role in the social sciences? How could the introduction of least squares predate the discovery of regression by more than eighty years? On what grounds can the major works of men such as Bernoulli, De Moivre, Bayes, Quetelet, and Lexis be considered partial failures, while those of Laplace, Galton, Edgeworth, Pearson, and Yule are counted as successes? How did Galton’s probability machine (the quincunx) provide him with the key to the major advance of the last half of the nineteenth century? Stigler’s emphasis is upon how, when, and where the methods of probability theory were developed for measuring uncertainty in experimental and observational science, for reducing uncertainty, and as a conceptual framework for quantitative studies in the social sciences. He describes with care the scientific context in which the different methods evolved and identifies the problems (conceptual or mathematical) that retarded the growth of mathematical statistics and the conceptual developments that permitted major breakthroughs. Statisticians, historians of science, and social and behavioral scientists will gain from this book a deeper understanding of the use of statistical methods and a better grasp of the promise and limitations of such techniques. The product of ten years of research, The History of Statistics will appeal to all who are interested in the humanistic study of science.",,Harvard University Press,,History,,104490,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nWn9DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,38.1,GoogleBooks

Known as the religious belief rejecting evolutionary theory, creationism has become a global issue. Although it was often known as a problem unique among fundamentalist Protestants in the United States, it has been appropriated by people with diverse religions around the world, including Asia, Africa, Europe, and South America. Many scientists and educators perceive this dissemination as a threat to modern pedagogy and scholarship, although few of them are aware of its historical and cultural contexts. Through an intensive study of the birth and growth of the anti-evolutionary movement in South Korea during the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, this book traces an important part of this worldwide movement against evolution. The author argues that South Korean creationism started from the country's past as a developmental state during the Cold War but proliferated further amid subsequent democratization and globalization. Creationism reflected the new identifications of some Korean scientists and engineers with evangelical faith, who actively formed their own domain outside of the state hegemony and authority.

It turned out to be the most significant decision he was ever to make. If it were not for Christ, he reflects, his would have been on the scrapheap of wasted and discarded lives. Instead, his life has been used to lead countless others around the world to that same new life, and into a deeper understanding of the One who gave his life that we might live. Now John Stott tells his spiritual story, and gives the reasons for his first life-changing step of faith on the path he has followed since that day. It was not so much that he found Christ, as that Christ found him. Not because the Christian faith is attractive, but because it is true. Not because he deserved to be saved, but because Christ took his sins, and ours, on himself. It is because the answer to the paradox at the heart of our humanness, because the key to true freedom and fulfilment, are to be found in Jesus Christ alone.

Lee presents a corrected and fully annotated version of Frye's text, as well as a comprehensive introduction to help contextualize this important work and guide readers through its allusive passages. Lee's introduction provides a synoptic account of the role of the Bible in Frye's intellectual and spiritual odyssey, as well as a description of how The Great Code as a book came into existence, and an introductory critique of the shape and meaning of the book's argument. The Great Code is culturally allusive to a high degree. It takes much of its inspiration from the Bible itself, including a profusion of biblical passages, but also from the author's extensive reading of a host of other texts from ancient times until the late twentieth century. Lee's extensive annotation illustrates, beyond question, that Frye's knowledge of the Bible and how it has worked in Western culture was at once profound and visionary. This new edition not only re-presents Frye's text in a clear, correct, and fully annotated form, it goes a long way in helping us understand the widespread scholarly and popular reception that met this extraordinary and in some ways revolutionary book and how it can still be richly rewarding for readers.",Frederick Ungar Publishing Co,University of Toronto Press,Biblical Studies,Literary Collections,Hardback,101374,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Lb_Rq66W4g0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,36.61,GoogleBooks

Charles & Green Bright,Andrew Ter Ern Loke,1879,2017,,"1108202233, 9781108202237",133,,,"In recent years, there has been considerable debate concerning the origin of divine Christology. Nevertheless, the proposed theories are beset with problems, such as failing to address the evidence of widespread agreement among the earliest Christians concerning divine Christology, and the issues related to whether Jesus' intention was falsified. This book offers a new contribution by addressing these issues using transdisciplinary tools. It proposes that the earliest Christians regarded Jesus as divine because a sizeable group of them perceived that Jesus claimed and showed himself to be divine, and thought that God vindicated this claim by raising Jesus from the dead. It also provides a comprehensive critique of alternative proposals, and synthesizes their strengths. It defends the appropriateness and merits of utilizing philosophical distinctions (e.g. between ontology and function) and Trinitarian concepts for explaining early Christology, and incorporates comparative religion by examining cases of deification in other contexts.",Geo T.Clarke,,Christianity / Debate,,Paperback,102569,,Reference,,36.59,GoogleBooks

His accusers identify in his ‘superman’ the origins of Nazism, and thus issue an irrevocable condemnation; his defenders pursue a hermeneutics of innocence founded ultimately in allegory. In a work that constitutes the most important contribution to Nietzschean studies in recent decades, Domenico Losurdo instead pursues a less reductive strategy. Taking literally the ruthless implications of Nietzsche's anti-democratic thinking – his celebration of slavery, of war and colonial expansion, and eugenics – he nevertheless refuses to treat these from the perspective of the mid-twentieth century. In doing so, he restores Nietzsche’s works to their complex nineteenth-century context, and presents a more compelling account of the importance of Nietzsche as philosopher than can be expected from his many contemporary apologists.

This book provides expert observations so that you can comprehend more of Scripture than you ever have before. The Bible was written for us—but not to us. We're not part of the ancient world that informed its writers. We're strangers to their ideas, experiences, and worldview. Because we're cultural and historical outsiders, what we read in the Bible can often be perplexing and leave us with more questions than answers. For instance: What purpose did Old Testament creation stories and genealogies serve when they were written? Why do the ancient Israelites talk about the gods of other nations as though they were real? Why do the gospel accounts differ from each other, and can we trust them? Is everything in the Bible ultimately about Jesus? Each of this book's 80 short chapters consist of statements or insights about the Bible, many of which may surprise even those who grew up in a Christian tradition. Throughout Brief Insights on Mastering the Bible (part of the 60 Second Scholar series), you'll tour each section of Scripture, tackling themes, details, and misunderstandings with the goal of seeing Scripture as what it really is and not what we would prefer that it is.

The composition process for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam begins in grief and ends in the victory of the self over death.

This question is provoking political and legal battles, fought on uncertain terrain, for ever-higher stakes. The posting of faculty lecture notes on commercial Web sites is being hotly debated in multiple forums, even as faculty and university administrators square off in a battle for professorial copyright. In courtrooms throughout the country, universities find themselves embroiled in intricate and expensive patent litigation. Meanwhile, junior researchers are appearing in those same courtrooms, using intellectual property rules to challenge traditional academic hierarchies. All but forgotten in these ownership disputes is a more fundamental question: should academic work be owned at all? Once characterized as a kind of gift, academic work--and academic freedom--are now being reframed as private intellectual property. Drawing on legal, historical, and qualitative research, Corynne McSherry explores the propertization of academic work and shows how that process is shaking the foundations of the university, the professoriate, and intellectual property law. The modern university's reason for being is inextricably tied to that of the intellectual property system. The rush of universities and scholars to defend their knowledge as property dangerously undercuts a working covenant that has sustained academic life--and intellectual property law--for a century and a half. As the value structure of the research university is replaced by the inequalities of the free market, academics risk losing a language for talking about knowledge as anything other than property.

Should Philosophers Be Kings?,What Should Philosophy Do?,A Boyce Gibson,Steven Yates,1939,2021-07-12,,"9781725263758, 1725263750",43,325,,"Philosophy as an academic discipline has fallen on hard times. Its practitioners might retort that never have there been so many books, articles, blogs, etc. But quantity is not quality, and while philosophers are graduating with PhDs few are finding adequate employment, and this is just the most visible problem. The question, What Should Philosophy Do?, is going begging, and the social justice warriors have tried to transform it into one of their political platforms right along with the rest of the liberal arts or humanities. In this book, philosopher Steven Yates revisits the question anew and comes up with a fresh perspective. He argues that philosophy is not a mere academic discipline, that it has a job to do in civilization that transcends its academic niche. He argues that philosophy should identify, clarify, and evaluate worldviews—noting their contributions, noticed as such or not, to the conversations of civilization, examining their capacity to solve problems, their consistency, and their overall adequacy in helping us live. Yates concludes that we should revisit the Christian worldview, and perhaps other worldviews, as part of an intellectual move towards a philosophical pluralism that emphasizes the freedom and intrinsic value of persons and could provide an alternative to the technocratic world order towards which we are presently heading at breakneck pace.",Melbourne University Press,Wipf and Stock Publishers,Philosophy,Education,Paperback,101353,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mQs8EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,35.41,GoogleBooks

Rock art in Dakhleh was produced for perhaps as long as 10 millennia, resulting in the formation of hundreds of sites displaying thousands of images. In some places, petroglyphs form a true melting pot of iconographic creations, elsewhere only isolated depictions appear on rock surfaces. Various rock art traditions, from prehistoric, through pharaonic, Graeco-Roman, and mediaeval, have all added to a tremendous variety of petroglyphs, their formal traits and subject matter. This book is the first ever monograph on Dakhleh Oasis rock art, providing both an introduction to the versatile topic as well as an overview of the current state of research. It is designed as a collection of essays that deal with specific aspects of the research. The reader is offered here not only old and new documentation, much of it previously unpublished, but also a great deal of innovative interpretation. All chapters, although devoted to different case studies, revolve around an all-encompassing concept of landscape of motion. It is argued here that rock art, regardless of its date of origin, was (and is) always involved in certain dynamic contexts. In Dakhleh, the majority of petroglyphs – especially during historical periods – were produced in spatial contexts of paths and routes, and thus by people on the move. It is argued here that various kinds of movement were often a significant factor contributing to the meaning and function of the images. The intention of this book is to explore and unveil such contexts, which may prove somewhat elusive if we focus our analyses exclusively on the representational aspects of rock art. Such a type of integration of rock art, landscape and motion is the major aim of this work, and has hopefully been achieved by merging perspectives and concepts derived from Egyptology, Anthropology, and other social sciences.",Mangawhai Press,Oxbow Books,Philosophy,Social Science,Paperback,102954,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=B_8XEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,35,GoogleBooks

This fascinating examination of the earliest years of Christianity reveals how the man we call St. Paul shaped Christianity as we know it today. Historians know almost nothing about the two decades following the crucifixion of Jesus, when his followers regrouped and began to spread his message. During this time Paul joined the movement and began to preach to the gentiles. Using the oldest Christian documents that we have—the letters of Paul—as well as other early Chris­tian sources, historian and scholar James Tabor reconstructs the origins of Christianity. Tabor shows how Paul separated himself from Peter and James to introduce his own version of Christianity, which would continue to develop independently of the message that Jesus, James, and Peter preached.

Halbfass presents previously unknown materials concerning the history of sectarian movements, including the notorious Thags (thaka), and relations between Indian and Iranian thought. The approach is partly philosophical and partly historical and philological; to a certain extent, it is also comparative. The author explores indigenous Indian reflections on the sources, the structure and the meaning of the Hindu tradition, and traditional philosophical responses to social and historical realities. He does not deal with social and historical realities per se; rather, basing his work on the premise that to understand these realities the reflections and constructions of traditional Indian theorists are no less significant than the observations and paradigms of modern Western historians and social scientists, he explores the self-understanding of such leading thinkers as Sankara, Kumarila, Bhartrhari and Udayana.",,SUNY Press,,Religion,,106347,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=titg6iWPc1MC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,34.9,GoogleBooks

Hotema says a true decipherment of the Tarot Symbolism must conform to the principles of the Ageless Wisdom of the Ancient Masters as preserved in the symbology and allegory contained in the Christian Bible and in other ancient scriptures, otherwise the interpretation will fail to agree with the teachings of the Masters who originated and designed the Major Arcana. The 78 Tarot Cards are fully illustrated. The Ancient Tarot was the oldest Bible on earth, and an interpretation of its mysterious symbolism reveals the Cosmic Phenomena that was presented to the Neophyte in the Sacred Drama of the Initiation in the Ancient Mysteries which included the strangest mysteries of Life, such as Reincarnation, Resurrection and Eternal Life. Hotema with his penetrating pen and wisdom clearly shows you secrets you have not known before. “Hotema’s folios astound me with the information they reveal.”—T. P. McG., N.Y. “We consider Prof. Hotema one of the world’s greatest teachers.”—Grant E. Hockens, N.Y. “We are slowly and gradually led into the realm of genius, and shown the answers to many profound anthropological and psychological problems that have perplexed the best scholars for ages. It was left for the mind of Prof. Hotema to correlate and analyze all existing data, as well as to decode the symbols and allegories of the Ancient Masters, and to reach and explain the facts and conclusions which are of immense value to mankind, both new and in the future.

Gentile's ""actualism"" (as his philosophy came to be called) absorbed many intellectual currents of the early twentieth century, including nationalism, syndicalism, and futurism. He called the individual to an idealistic ethic of obedience, work, self-sacrifi ce, and national community in a dynamic rebellion against the perceived impostures of imperialism.

He has two tales to tell. One, spanning post-war Paris, 1950s Soho and contemporary sexual and scholarly entanglements, surveys the muddle of his own life. The other, drawn from the notebooks of a Victorian ancestor, is the very different story of Matthew Pearce, a serious-minded man whose happiness is destroyed by his compulsive search for truth. Bill’s recollections of his beautiful wife, his wayward mother and his philandering stepfather, his wry reflections on his present plight and his unexpected bond with the forgotten Matthew combine to form a potent and moving mental quest.

Jacob Burak is on a quest to answer the question “are we as human beings, who are separated by different cultures and experiences, similar or different?” Through the lens of behavioural studies, we see how, while our approaches differ and often conflict, we all strive for similar things: love, acceptance, power and understanding. How to Find a Black Cat in a Dark Room offers the latest scientific studies of human behaviour alongside accessible anecdotes to examine the universal human experiences of comparing ourselves to others, the need to belong, the urge to achieve and the anxiety and uncertainty of life itself. More importantly, Burak shows us how, in understanding these behavioural patterns, we learn that we are actually more alike than we are different; that our rivals often make us stronger; and that being trusting can help us live longer. With his inquisitive nature, logical thinking and engaging style, Burak examines whether it is destiny or personality that controls our lives, through intriguing subjects such as: • What are the ten rules for happiness that are entirely under our control? • Why do smart people make stupid mistakes? • What distinguishes bureaucrats and entrepreneurs? • What are the psychological differences between liberals and conservatives? • In what circumstances is it right to surrender our privacy? • Does it pay to trust people?",,Watkins Media Limited,,Psychology,,104245,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bwkEDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,33.52,GoogleBooks

Arguing for a revival of the invisible hand of free international trade and global capital, eminent economist Deepak Lal vigorously defends the view that statist attempts to ameliorate the impact of markets threaten global economic progress and stability. And in an unusual move, he not only defends globalization economically, but also answers the cultural and moral objections of antiglobalizers. Taking a broad cross-cultural and interdisciplinary approach, Lal argues that there are two groups opposed to globalization: cultural nationalists who oppose not capitalism but Westernization, and ""new dirigistes"" who oppose not Westernization but capitalism. In response, Lal contends that capitalism doesn't have to lead to Westernization, as the examples of Japan, China, and India show, and that ""new dirigiste"" complaints have more to do with the demoralization of their societies than with the capitalist instruments of prosperity. Lal bases his case on a historical account of the rise of capitalism and globalization in the first two liberal international economic orders: the nineteenth-century British, and the post-World War II American. Arguing that the ""new dirigisme"" is the thin edge of a wedge that could return the world to excessive economic intervention by states and international organizations, Lal does not shrink from controversial stands such as advocating the abolishment of these organizations and defending the existence of child labor in the Third World.",Liberty Institute,Princeton University Press,Environmentalism / Economics,Business & Economics,Paperback,101899,9.95,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qU1f2XP_NfQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,33.04,GoogleBooks

In so doing, the book marks a radical departure from both the new atheism and the mainstream of modern ethical philosophy. While in synch with their underlying aim of grounding human existence in a naturalistic metaphysics, the book takes both to task for maintaining a complacent embrace of morality. Marks advocates wiping the slate clean of outdated connotations by replacing the language of morality with a language of desire. The book begins with an analysis of what morality is and then argues that the concept is not instantiated in reality. Following this, the question of belief in morality is addressed: How would human life be affected if we accepted that morality does not exist? Marks argues that at the very least, a moralist would have little to complain about in an amoral world, and at best we might hope for a world that was more to our liking overall. An extended look at the human encounter with nonhuman animals serves as an illustration of amorality's potential to make both theoretical and practical headway in resolving heretofore intractable ethical problems.",,Routledge,Atheism,Philosophy,,103236,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=q_vFMphQwQ0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,32.63,GoogleBooks

Compassion Tempered by Reality,Compassion in Healthcare,Dr Burnell,Joshua Hordern,2006,2020-10-30,,"9780192508270, 019250827X",,399,Memoirs,"Compassion in Healthcare gives an account of the nature and content of compassion and its role in healthcare. While compassion appears to be a straightforward aspect of life and practice, Hordern's analysis shows that it is plagued by both conceptual and practical ills, and stands in need of some quite specific kinds of therapy. Starting from a diagnosis of what precisely is wrong with 'compassion'--its debilitating political entanglements, the vagueness of its meaning, and the risk of burnout it threatens--three therapies are prescribed for these ills: an understanding of patients and healthcare workers as those who pass through the life-course, encountering each other as wayfarers and pilgrims; a grasp of the nature of compassion in healthcare; and an embedding of healthcare within the realities of civic life. Applying these therapeutic strategies uncovers how compassionate relationships acquire their content in healthcare practice. The form that compassion takes is shown to depend on how doctrines of time, tragedy, salvation, responsibility, fault, and theodicy make a difference to the quality of people's lives and relationships. Drawing on the author's real-world collaborations, the way in which compassion matters to practice and policy is worked out in the detail of healthcare professionalism, marketization, and technology. Covering everything from conception to old age, and from machine learning to religious diversity, Compassion in Healthcare draws on philosophy, theology, and everyday experience to expand our understanding of what compassion means for healthcare practice.",,Oxford University Press,Memoirs,Religion,,102445,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=efkFEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,32.5,GoogleBooks

Though the twenty-first century could be the critical era in which life on Earth spreads beyond our solar system, it is just as likely that we have endangered the future of the entire universe. With clarity and precision, Rees maps out the ways technology could destroy our species and thereby foreclose the potential of a living universe whose evolution has just begun. Rees boldly forecasts the startling risks that stem from our accelerating rate of technological advances. We could be wiped out by lethal ""engineered"" airborne viruses, or by rogue nano-machines that replicate catastrophically. Experiments that crash together atomic nuclei could start a chain reaction that erodes all atoms of Earth, or could even tear the fabric of space itself. Through malign intent or by mistake, a single event could trigger global disaster. Though we can never completely safeguard our future, increased regulation and inspection can help us to prevent catastrophe. Rees's vision of the infinite future that we have put at risk -- a cosmos more vast and diverse than any of us has ever imagined -- is both a work of stunning scientific originality and a humanistic clarion call on behalf of the future of life.",Basic books,Hachette UK,Science/Technology/humanism,Science,,104911,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=W5U5DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,32.5,GoogleBooks

Un-questionably one of the most important achievements of the millennium, its publication in 1859 caused a sensation, because it forced mankind to see itself as part of the animal world--a notion that hundreds of millions still deny. Darwin's theory of common descent did for biology what Galileo did for astronomy: made it into a single science rather than a collection of unrelated facts. Those facts, however, are now a century and a half old, as are ""The Origin's illustrative examples and Victorian prose style. Writing as ""Darwin's ghost,"" the well-known geneticist Steve Jones has drawn on our ever-expanding scientific knowledge and the brilliant logic set out in ""The Origin to restate evolution's case for the twenty-first century. Jones has been called ""the British Carl Sagan"" because of his prominence as a popularizer of science. Using contemporary examples--the AIDS virus, the rules of the American Kennel Club, the sheep who never forget a face and the garbage that floats in the Pacific--he shows the power and imme-diacy of Darwin's great argument.

We worry about the next few hundred years, yet miss its long-term magnitude. So what will the world look like? Curt Stager draws on geological history to show that the greatest threat to humans will not be global warming, but global cooling. When that hot 'backlash' eventually happens is entirely up to us: We have already put off the next Ice Age, but whether our descendents will see an ice-free Arctic, miles of submerged coasts, or an acidified ocean can still be decided. Whether we continue to pollute or rein ourselves in for the sake of future generations, the world will be vastly different.

Halbfass presents previously unknown materials concerning the history of sectarian movements, including the notorious Thags (thaka), and relations between Indian and Iranian thought. The approach is partly philosophical and partly historical and philological; to a certain extent, it is also comparative. The author explores indigenous Indian reflections on the sources, the structure and the meaning of the Hindu tradition, and traditional philosophical responses to social and historical realities. He does not deal with social and historical realities per se; rather, basing his work on the premise that to understand these realities the reflections and constructions of traditional Indian theorists are no less significant than the observations and paradigms of modern Western historians and social scientists, he explores the self-understanding of such leading thinkers as Sankara, Kumarila, Bhartrhari and Udayana.",Minneapolis,SUNY Press,Theology,Religion,,104849,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=titg6iWPc1MC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,32.09,GoogleBooks

You may have learned in world history class that the fall of the Roman Empire led to centuries of violence, ignorance, and barbarism in Europe. But that’s not all that happened during that time! The period between the fall of the Roman Empire and the High Middle Ages also was characterized by institutional, spiritual, and cultural advancements such as the rise of monasticism with St. Benedict of Nursia and the first encyclopedia by a Christian writer, St. Isidore of Seville. In The Church and the Dark Ages (430–1027), author Phillip Campbell explains that the Dark Ages were not only a period of great political and cultural transition but also an era of great transformation in the Catholic Church. Campbell highlights key personalities of the Dark Ages such as St. Gregory the Great, Charlemagne, King Alfred the Great, St. Patrick, and St. Brigid. You will learn that: Benedictines were responsible for technical and scientific advancements such as the mechanical clock, human flight, and eyeglasses. The Dark Ages was a period of great evangelization throughout Europe. Christianity elevated the status of women, particularly through mutual consent in the Sacrament of Marriage. The Church preserved literacy—and literature—throughout the chaotic centuries of early medieval Europe.

The controversy culminated in a letter written by a lay assistant professor to the Cincinnati archbishop, Karl J. Alter. In the letter, the professor cited a number of instances where “erroneous teachings” were “endorsed” or “openly advocated” by four lay faculty members. Concerned about the pastoral impact on the University of Dayton community, the professor asked the archbishop to conduct an investigation. How the University weathered this controversy, the second of three major controversies to hit Catholic higher education within three years (St. John’s University, University of Dayton and the Curran affair at Catholic University of America), is of interest to faculty and administrators in Catholic higher education who continue to struggle with defining what it means to be a “Catholic” university, with the relationship of Catholic universities to the Church at large and the hierarchy in particular, and with Church teachings that conflict with the culture we live in such as immigration, the environment and sexual ethics.

The book represents the state of the art on a fascinating period, when paganism in all its forms gradually yielded to monotheism. It combines philology and archaeology, with more than twenty contributions offering a presentation of unknown textual and iconographic material. Egyptian deities and temples are discussed both from the point of view of institutions and of personal religion. In the multicultural society of Graeco-Roman Egypt the relationship between native Egyptians and Greek culture is always at the center of the interest. Thanks to the indexes this will become a standard work of reference in the field of Egyptian religion.

Reflecting on employees' personal values and world views, it then examines their impact on the development and application of your organisation's mission, vision and values and finally, your organisation's impact on the societies and environment in which it operates.

In a brief essay that is a birds eye view of the character of scientists over time, specialty and method, we find that only one common denominator persists: their curiosity and passion for science. What happens then to this drive in the cutthroat biotech industry or in the ravines of bioethical issues like those relating to IVF? The two themes are developed in fictional stories based on real characters. A companionable guide, Jim, participates to the events unfolding and tells them. As a scientist at the forefront of his research in one story and as a mature science journalist in the other, Jim often finds refuge in mental games and visual models of his own creation and thus survives the upheavals. In Bourse Brigands financial interests hijack science while Alba, its committed protagonist, fights for her passion to ferry science across to the wider world. In Eves Speed a young embryologist finds two mutant human embryos in her IVF work. But her life spins out of control when scientific arrogance raises its head and makes her blind to reality and ethical rules. The Scientist offers a glimpse into another world not just through its technical details but also because it shows how scientists think and behave. We are in the factual world of IVF, embryology, stem cell research, commercial and scientific clashes, professional paranoia and the legal and ethical issues that all raise.","Time-Life, Nederland",Author House,Science / Childrens,Fiction,Hardback,102070,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=m-bfwNn6dngC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,30.93,GoogleBooks

It spans many spheres of everyday life, and the ethical dimension of design practice that considers environmental, social and economic sustainability is compelling. Approaches to design recognise design as a practice that can transform human experience and understanding, expanding its role beyond stylistic enhancement. The traditional roles of design, designer and designed object are therefore redefined through new understanding of the relationship between the material and immaterial aspects of design where the design product and the design process are embodiments of ideas, values and beliefs. This multi-disciplinary approach considers how to create design which is at once aesthetically pleasing and also ethically considered, with contributions from fields as diverse as architecture, fashion, urban design and philosophy. The authors also address how to teach design based subjects while instilling a desire in the student to develop ethical work practices, both inside and outside the studio.","Watts, London",Routledge,Debate,Architecture,,102275,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=m0oWywvtS10C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,30.58,GoogleBooks

We learn of the ongoing struggle between the gods, who create the cosmos, and the jötnar, or giants, who aim to destroy it.

It is a fictionalised account of the life of the philosopher Hypatia, and tells the story of a young monk called Philammon who travels to Alexandria, where he becomes mixed up in the political and religious battles of the day. Intended as Christian apologia it reflects typical 19th-century religious sentiments of the day. For many years the book was considered one of Kingsley's best novels and was widely read.The plot revolves around Hypatia the pagan philosopher; Cyril the Christian patriarch; Orestes the power-hungry prefect of Egypt; and Philammon an Egyptian monk.

This book recounts and analyzes the history of the church of Canada’s largest Protestant denomination and its engagement with issues of social and private morality, evangelistic campaigns, and its response to the restructuring of religion in the 1960s. A chronological history is followed by chapters on the United Church’s worship, theology, understanding of ministry, relationships with the Canadian Jewish community, Israel, and Palestinians, changing mission goals in relation to First Nations peoples, and changing social imaginary. The result is an original, accessible, and engaging account of The United Church of Canada’s pilgrimage that will be useful for students, historians, and general readers. From this account there emerges a complex portrait of the United Church as a distinctly Canadian Protestant church shaped by both its Christian faith and its engagement with the changing society of which it is a part.",Watts & Co.

Gary's sister Taren consults mediums to process grief after a death in their family. Gary, concerned she's being exploited, remains sceptical. When he reports on a clairvoyant's link to a huge stockbroking firm collapse, personal questions become professional. Why do so many surprising people believe? So begins a two-year investigation into the colourful world of psychic-mediums and sceptic activists. Gary tries out some psychics himself, sometimes with hilarious results. He hears about their secret influence over world leaders, CEOs, news editors and the criminal justice system.

More specifically, it analyzes why American state policies are largely tolerant of religion, whereas French and Turkish policies generally prohibit its public visibility, as seen in their bans on Muslim headscarves. In the United States, the dominant ideology is 'passive secularism', which requires the state to play a passive role, by allowing public visibility of religion. Dominant ideology in France and Turkey is 'assertive secularism', which demands that the state play an assertive role in excluding religion from the public sphere. Passive and assertive secularism became dominant in these cases through certain historical processes, particularly the presence or absence of an ancien régime based on the marriage between monarchy and hegemonic religion during state-building periods.",Human-Etisk Forbund,Cambridge University Press,Secularism / Benelux,Social Science,Paperback,102510,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Oj8hifN4wZgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,29.29,GoogleBooks

But Sam knows his grandfather too well. For some reason, the wily old man has decided that one of his three grandsons should marry Willa, and this is his way of trying to force the issue ... So Willa and Sam team up on what seems like a wild-goose chase to find some loophole in Grandfather Sinclair's crazy notion. But as Sam crews Willa's yacht en route to Maine, he finds to his surprise that his grandfather's offbeat scheme is growing more attractive by the moment. Willa is smart, beautiful ... and has a wild streak that sends them soaring together above the clouds. But Willa isn't about to let Sam fly away with her heart until she knows his true motives.

Its mission was, among other goals, to promote rationalism and secular education as well as to publish freethought books at affordable prices. For more than a century the RPA has served as a bastion of reason in an often-irrational world. Its Honorary Associates have included such luminaries of the 20th century as Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud, J. B. S. Haldane, Julian Huxley, Somerset Maugham, Bertrand Russell, H. G. Wells, and others. Now experienced freethought historian Bill Cooke has written the first history of the RPA, delving deeply into its archives to tell a fascinating and illuminating story. Cooke discusses the association's achievements and ideas, and profiles the key people involved in its development. At the same time, he does not shy away from its difficulties and controversies, offering a critical perspective that rationalists will certainly appreciate. He covers the historical background of the RPA's formation, the crucial role played by Charles Albert Watts, its enormous publishing successes, the vicissitudes of war and peace, and the evolution of rationalist ideas. Full bibliographies and appendices are also included. This scholarly yet highly readable and witty history of the Rationalist Press Association will be welcomed by all who value reason as humanity's best hope for the future.",Rationalist Press Association,,RPA / History,Business & Economics,,100158,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=o4TXAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,28.95,GoogleBooks

It is unlikely that most people reach the end of their lives without wondering what it has all been for and what happens next. But the question of belief is more than just academic, since what people believe is now more critical than ever. As G R Evans shows, an ignorance of the history of beliefs can leave individuals susceptible to the influence of extreme ideas, and unsure how to put them into context and judge their validity. In all religions, not just Islam and Christianity, that is precisely how sects and cults get a grip. This book shows how ethical questions fit together, and how great historical debates and decision-making - whether about religious conflict, or theodicy, or questions of authority - shed light on some of the great moral challenges facing the religions today. Concentrating especially on the Christian tradition, Evans shows how the history of religious debate can help us to understand the nature of current misunderstandings and division over belief, a crucial step for people of all faiths in the new century.",University Press of Virginia,Bloomsbury Publishing,Theology,Religion,,104810,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mg2MDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,28.85,GoogleBooks

In the late 1980s, to the surprise of nearly everyone, it suddenly collapsed. Why did this happen? And what role did Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev’s economic reforms play in the country’s dissolution? In this groundbreaking study, Chris Miller shows that Gorbachev and his allies tried to learn from the great success story of transitions from socialism to capitalism, Deng Xiaoping’s China. Why, then, were efforts to revitalize Soviet socialism so much less successful than in China? Making use of never-before-studied documents from the Soviet politburo and other archives, Miller argues that the difference between the Soviet Union and China — and the ultimate cause of the Soviet collapse — was not economics but politics. The Soviet government was divided by bitter conflict, and Gorbachev, the ostensible Soviet autocrat, was unable to outmaneuver the interest groups that were threatened by his economic reforms.

Writings on the lives and theories of individual social scientists abound, but there has been no fully documented collection of memorable quotations from the social sciences as a whole. The frequent use of quotations in scientific as well as literary writings that are mere summaries or paraphrases typically fail to capture the full force of formulations that have made quotations memorable. This book of quotations invites the further reading or rereading of the original texts, beyond the quotations themselves. Sills and Merton draw extensively upon the writings that constitute the historical core of the social sciences and social thought; those works with staying power often described as the ""classical texts."" Many quotations have been drawn from these classical texts because the quotations contain memorable ideas memorably expressed. Both consequential and memorable, these words have been quoted over the generations, entering into the collective memory of social scientists everywhere and at times diffusing into popular thought and into the vernacular as well. This book is useful to social scientists, anthropologists, economists, historians, political scientists, psychiatrists, psychologists, sociologists and statisticians, and for all who want to learn or verify memorable formulations and phrases concerning social thought and social theories. It is particularly useful for graduate students taking courses that examine the history of their discipline.",,Routledge,Science,Social Science,,104715,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IlAPEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,28.13,GoogleBooks

Roussopoulos,1970,2007,,"1551642980, 9781551642987",,196,,"The greatest contribution of the New Left of the 1960s was its determination to build a culture and politics of popular participation at every level of society. A radical conception of democracy, it inspired the movements for civil rights, for peace and solidarity, and for gender and sexual equality. It framed the social debate, in terms of community-centered democratic theory, which continues to guide and inspire well into the twenty-first century. As the contributors to this anthology revisit the 1960s to identify its ongoing impact on North American politics and culture, it becomes evident how this legacy has blended with and influenced today’s worldwide social movements, in particular, the anti-globalization movement and the Right to the City movement. The successes and failures of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as they struggle for a voice at global levels are examined, as are the new movements of the urban disenfranchised-the homeless, the alienated youth, the elderly poor. Apart from evoking memories of past peace and freedom struggles from those who worked on the social movements of the 1960s, this work also includes a number of essays from a rising generation of scholars, too young to have experienced the 1960s firsthand, whose perspective as non-participants enables them to offer fresh interpretations. Dimitrios Roussopoulos, a prominent New Left activist in the 1960s, continues to write and edit on major international issues while being a committed activist, testing theory with practice.",,Black Rose Books Ltd.,Politics,History,,104368,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WIm7-RRDoSUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,28.13,GoogleBooks

Both his life and teachings are radical in that Jesus intended those who observed his life and heard his teachings to make a major change in their lives by fully receiving the power and presence of God. The implications of this transformation would result in a life of loving God with heart and mind and one's neighbor without condition. This volume underlines that to have a full understanding of the implications of the radical teaching of Jesus requires a careful reading of the history--of the Gospel records, of the circumstances in which Jesus lived, and of Jesus' sense of vocation. This understanding makes possible a more credible and nuanced grasp of the style and content of the life and teaching of Jesus and its extraordinary relevance for our rapidly changing and troubled global context. The book speaks poignantly both to those within the Christian family who find traditional categories regarding Jesus increasingly difficult to affirm, and to those of other faith traditions or religious unaffiliated who seek an authentic spiritual way.",Rationalist Press Association,Wipf and Stock Publishers,Biblical Studies,Religion,Hardback,103858,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=V0uPCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,28.03,GoogleBooks

Athenaeums proliferated in the first century after the Dutch Revolt, but few of them survived long. They have been interpreted as the manifestation of an evolving vision of the role of a higher education; this book, by contrast, argues that education at the Amsterdam Athenaeum was staunchly traditional both in methods and in substance. While religious, philosophical and scientific disputes rocked contemporary Dutch learned society, this analysis of letters, orations and disputations reveals that a traditional and Aristotelian humanism thrived at the Athenaeum until well into the seventeenth century.",Pelican Books,BRILL,History / Philosophy,History,Paperback,103316,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ey6wCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,27.84,GoogleBooks
From Faith to Reason,From Truth and truth,Brian Baker,Francis Etheredge,2009,2016-04-26,,"9781443892032, 1443892033",,293,,"What emerges in this second book of the trilogy is that the very “ground” and content of experience is richer than what can be reduced to a particular account of it. As such, dialogue develops from the “natural” diversity of what is “of” faith and what is “of” reason. Neither faith nor reason, however, originates “from” experience; rather, both are “witnessed” in experience. In other words, taking up questions about the nature of man, whether philosophically, psychologically or in terms of social structures, manifests both a variety of points of departure and, at the same time, the manifold conversations that are possible in the “field of culture”.Focusing particularly on the work of St. John Paul II, the first essay examines the answer of reason and the answer of faith to the same question: What is man? Conversion, too, entails an “unexpected” relationship to natural truth, which, in its own way, is both adequate and inadequate to salvation. Communication, as it were, runs throughout these essays; however, in particular, there is a need to enrich our human understanding of the process of “coming to ourselves” with the insights of spiritual discernment. Axiomatically, however, it is possible to say that just as we come to exist through a relationship to others, so our healing and holiness are manifest through our relationship to others in the “Other”. Furthermore, while it is ultimately true that we exist as individually rooted in the social structure of our origin and the times in which we live, we need to critically participate in the dialogue which identifies our common “reality” and not live our lives covered in “psycho-social” labels of one kind or another.As a whole, then, there is an incomparable range and depth to “dialogue”. Indeed, given the many critical situations in the world, it is increasingly indispensable and essential that humanity choose the incredible wealth of dialogue in contrast to the possibility of a “polarised” and “conflictual” structure between people and peoples.",,Cambridge Scholars Publishing,,Philosophy,,104165,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=njL5DAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,27.73,GoogleBooks

In the original text, the author argues that the notion of 'anorexia' as a medical condition limits our understanding of anorexia and the extent to which we can explore it as a socially and discursively produced problem. The book now has a new introduction that discusses some of the major cultural and academic developments that have occurred since its first publication. In considering our changing cultural landscapes, the introduction goes on to discuss the so-called ‘obesity crisis’; the emergence of post-feminism; the massive global expansion of digital and social media and, most recently, the Covid-19 pandemic. Turning to academic developments, it focuses on the increasing recognition of intersectional feminism and reflects on how intersectional perspectives are now beginning to shape critical feminist research and theory in this field. The new introduction also highlights the significant growth in the last 25 years of critical feminist research on eating disorders, which has brought with it a greater awareness of intersectional theory and a more inclusive agenda; an expansion of research foci; a diversification of methodologies and the emergence of more egalitarian models of research in which those with lived experience of eating disorders are becoming valued research team members who help to shape research aims, designs and processes. Based on original research using historical and contemporary literature on anorexia nervosa and a series of interviews with women who identified as ‘anorexic’, this book offers critical insights into this problem. It is an invaluable read for anyone interested in eating disorders and gender, developments in feminist post-structuralist theory and discourse analytic research in psychology.",Humanist Friends Publishers,Taylor & Francis,Humanism,Psychology,Paperback,104925,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=f-znEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,27.44,GoogleBooks

Today's typical academic book in eschatology provides the reader with a brief history of the various positions in the field followed by why certain positions should be considered the better options. This is not that book. Over the course of twelve chapters, six sequences will be presented from the three major sources in the New Testament regarding the subject, i.e., Paul's letters to the Thessalonians, the Olivet Discourse, and John's visions in Revelation. Through a careful reconciliation of those six sequences, Dr. Steven R. Bates will show that there's only one sequence of end-times, which he has labeled ""The Post-Armageddon, Premillennial Resurrection."" He asserts that had any other sequence of end-times been correct, whether pre-tribulationism, pre-wrath, mid-tribulationism, historic pre-millennialism, post-millennialism, a-millennialism, preterism, or any other sequence that one could possibly imagine, then the proponents of that postulation should be able to take the same six sequences from Scripture and reconcile them precisely with one another, sentence by sentence, and prove whatever sequence they propose. But, of course, no one will ever attempt such an endeavor because it's theoretically impossible.

Written in a candid and provocative style, this work is infused with Strindberg's characteristic psychological depth and realism, as he delves into themes of gender conflict and existential angst. The novel'Äôs fragmented structure and stream-of-consciousness narrative create an immersive experience, reflecting the chaotic nature of human emotions and the societal constraints of the late 19th century. Strindberg, a prominent figure in modern drama, was profoundly influenced by his tumultuous personal life, marked by failed marriages and conflicting ideologies about gender. His experiences provided a rich backdrop for 'ÄúMarried,'Äù as he explored the dissonance between romantic ideals and the harsh realities of marriage, shedding light on the deeply ingrained cultural norms of his time. His engagement with themes of power dynamics in relationships illustrates his broader philosophical inquiries into human nature and societal roles. For readers drawn to psychological exploration and social critique, ""Married"" offers an unflinching examination of the human condition. Strindberg'Äôs keen observations and eloquent prose make this novel a compelling read, inviting reflection on the nature of love and the complexities of human connection.

The Hammurabi Code,The Code of Hammurabi,Edward John] Chilperic [Pseud: Pilcher Edwards,"Hammurabi, Claude Hermann Walter Johns",1904,2024-11-24,,"9786057876645, 6057876644",168,46,,"The Code of Hammurabi is a well-preserved Babylonian law code of ancient Mesopotamia, dating back to about 1754 BC. It is one of the oldest deciphered writings of significant length in the world. The sixth Babylonian king, Hammurabi, enacted the code, and partial copies exist on a man-sized stone stele and various clay tablets. The Code consists of 282 laws, with scaled punishments, adjusting ""an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth"" (lex talionis) as graded depending on social status, of slave versus free man. Nearly one-half of the Code deals with matters of contract, establishing, for example, the wages to be paid to an ox driver or a surgeon. Other provisions set the terms of a transaction, establishing the liability of a builder for a house that collapses, for example, or property that is damaged while left in the care of another. A third of the code addresses issues concerning household and family relationships such as inheritance, divorce, paternity, and sexual behavior. Only one provision appears to impose obligations on an official; this provision establishes that a judge who reaches an incorrect decision is to be fined and removed from the bench permanently. A few provisions address issues related to military service. Hammurabi ruled for nearly 42 years, c. 1792 to 1750 BC according to the Middle chronology. In the preface to the law, he states, ""Anu and Bel called by name me, Hammurabi, the exalted prince, who feared Marduk, the patron god of Babylon (The Human Record, Andrea & Overfield 2005), to bring about the rule in the land."" On the stone slab there are 44 columns and 28 paragraphs that contained 282 laws. The laws follow along the rules of 'an eye for an eye'.",Watts & Co,E-Kitap Projesi & Cheapest Books,Ancient History,History,Hardback,103129,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5T0yEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,26.81,GoogleBooks

A New York Times Notable Book. “Old Filth belongs in the Dickensian pantheon of memorable characters” (The New York Times Book Review). Sir Edward Feathers has had a brilliant career, from his early days as a lawyer in Southeast Asia, where he earned the nickname Old Filth (FILTH being an acronym for Failed In London Try Hong Kong) to his final working days as a respected judge at the English bar. Yet through it all he has carried with him the wounds of a difficult and emotionally hollow childhood. Now an eighty-year-old widower living in comfortable seclusion in Dorset, Feathers is finally free from the regimen of work and the sentimental scaffolding that has sustained him throughout his life. He slips back into the past with ever mounting frequency and intensity, and on the tide of these vivid, lyrical musings, Feathers approaches a reckoning with his own history. Not all the old filth, it seems, can be cleaned away. Borrowing from biography and history, Jane Gardam has written a literary masterpiece reminiscent of Rudyard Kipling’s “Baa Baa, Black Sheep” that retraces much of the twentieth century’s torrid and momentous history. SHORTLISTED FOR THE ORANGE PRIZE “Will bring immense pleasure to readers who treasure fiction that is intelligent, witty, sophisticated and—a quality encountered all too rarely in contemporary culture—adult.” —The Washington Post “Gardam is an exquisite storyteller, picking up threads, laying them down, returning to them and giving them new meaning . . .

Previously, scholars were not able to agree on how the term glaucoma, which related in antiquity to the color of a diseased eye, ended up describing an excavated optic neuropathy which has nothing to do with color. The volume begins in the ancient world, and proceeds all the way to the modern era of optical coherence tomography, minimally invasive surgery, and anti-VEGF agents. Ophthalmic historians and glaucoma specialists from the United States, Europe, Asia, and Latin America have contributed their scholarship and recollections to this volume, which includes photographs from private collections, information from unpublished documents, and new translations from Latin, Arabic, French, German, and Spanish. The work of masters such as Julius Hirschberg and Max Meyerhof is supplemented by the latest scholarship, which has benefited from the explosion in digitally-accessible historical documents. This new scholarship has upended many deeply rooted beliefs about ophthalmology history.

Unabridged (100% Original content) Font adjustments & biography included Illustrated About Candide by Voltaire Candide is a French satire first published in 1759 by Voltaire, a philosopher of the Age of Enlightenment. The novella has been widely translated, with English versions titled Candide: or, All for the Best (1759); Candide: or, The Optimist (1762); and Candide: or, Optimism (1947). It begins with a young man, Candide, who is living a sheltered life in an Edenic paradise and being indoctrinated with Leibnizian optimism (or simply ""optimism"") by his mentor, Professor Pangloss. The work describes the abrupt cessation of this lifestyle, followed by Candide's slow, painful disillusionment as he witnesses and experiences great hardships in the world. Voltaire concludes with Candide, if not rejecting optimism outright, advocating a deeply practical precept, ""we must cultivate our garden"", in lieu of the Leibnizian mantra of Pangloss, ""all is for the best"" in the ""best of all possible worlds"". Candide is characterised by its sarcastic tone as well as by its erratic, fantastical and fast-moving plot. A picaresque novel with a story similar to that of a more serious Bildungsroman, it parodies many adventure and romance clichés, the struggles of which are caricatured in a tone that is mordantly matter-of-fact. Still, the events discussed are often based on historical happenings, such as the Seven Years' War and the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.[8] As philosophers of Voltaire's day contended with the problem of evil, so too does Candide in this short novel, albeit more directly and humorously. Voltaire ridicules religion, theologians, governments, armies, philosophies, and philosophers through allegory; most conspicuously, he assaults Leibniz and his optimism.",Thornton Butterworth Ltd,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,Biography,,Hardback,102341,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=i890vgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,24.7,GoogleBooks

Why do we “dress up” for church? Why does the pastor preach a sermon each week? Why do we have pews, steeples, and choirs? This ground-breaking book, now in affordable softcover, makes an unsettling proposal: most of what Christians do in present-day churches is rooted, not in the New Testament, but in pagan culture and rituals developed long after the death of the apostles. Coauthors Frank Viola and George Barna support their thesis with compelling historical evidence and extensive footnotes that document the origins of modern Christian church practices. In the process, the authors uncover the problems that emerge when the church functions more like a business organization than the living organism it was created to be. As you reconsider Christ's revolutionary plan for his church—to be the head of a fully functioning body in which all believers play an active role—you'll be challenged to decide whether you can ever do church the same way again.",Pioneer Press,"Tyndale House Publishers, Inc.",Christianity / Paganism,Religion,Paperback,100966,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cPTBmcHa-i0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,24.51,GoogleBooks

It takes two approaches that have been relegated, quite unfairly, to the margins of dominant discourses. The first is concerned with the work of women philosophical theorists who are still overshadowed by their male colleagues, regardless of where they live, their theoretical potential, and the value of their research. The second approach is related to the question of the role of Taiwanese philosophy in maintaining the continuity of the Chinese intellectual tradition in the second half of the twentieth century. The book thus connects these two issues and provides a bridge linking them. Although discrimination against female philosophical theorists, on the one hand, and the failure to recognize the important contribution of Taiwanese philosophy to the development of modern Chinese philosophy, on the other, seem, at first glance, to have little in common, both harbor a problem that has its roots in discourses of exclusion emanating from the political, historical, and social inequalities associated with power structures.",Philosophical Library,Cambridge Scholars Publishing,Philosophy,Philosophy,,106016,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RpdEEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,23.91,GoogleBooks

In a world where religion is increasingly associated with hatred, bigotry, fanaticism, violence and misogyny, Jellie's story provides an alternative - a vision splendid - where values rooted in the liberal religious tradition are the very ones required to promote social justice, protect the powerless and reduce social and economic inequality. It is a story we can turn to for inspiration as we continue to work for fairness in society, equality of opportunity, and the enrichment of the human spirit. Jellie who was born in Ireland and educated at London University and Manchester College, Oxford began his career as minister to a Unitarian chapel and associated mission in an impoverished part of London. After a brief ministry in a quiet provincial town, he was ready for another challenge. Attracted by New Zealand's reputation for progressive social and economic reform, in 1900 he took on the leadership of a fledgling Unitarian movement in Auckland. Apart from a war time ministry in England he remained in New Zealand for the rest of his life, serving congregations in Auckland, Wellington, and Timaru. At nearly sixty years of age, at a time when many people start to think about retirement, Jellie began a new career in adult education. For the next fourteen years he was a tutor for the Workers Educational Association, an organization providing higher education to working-class people and trade union members unable to attend university. Throughout his long life Jellie lived out the Unitarian values of freedom of thought, tolerance, commitment to social justice and the use of reason in religion.

Confessions (Vol. 1),Sissy Confessions – Volume ONE!,Jean Jacques Rousseau,Mike Watson,1964,2022-05-17,,,320,138,,"Those confessions we all have, every sissy thinks – obsesses – takes it to bed with her – and more – thoughts that PLAGUE in a nice way – us all day long – thoughts we SO want to share with her, but sometimes can’t – and thoughts which ultimately shape what we DO! Why did I write this series? Certainly, with all the other writing I did along these lines, I dont have to! But as I look at my “wife” lying – fat thighs (so NICE, especially the rolls of fat, the lazier she is, the better, I’ve often said that, women should be entitled, bratty and LAZY, thats when they’re the most controlling, dominating, and ATTRACTIVE!!!!!!!!) – soles bobbing up and down, I can never get enough of serving her, and talking about COCK! And in general, while serving her, either sexually or otherwise talking about some of the things I talk about SO often here. Except, I dont talk about them ALL. Hehe. And I’m lucky in that I’m at least at this point where I can talk about SOME of it. Most men – their SO’s would throw a hissy and leave if they even MENTIONED any of their real desires, those dormant desires which I wrote about before – NEVER go away – and everyone has them, no matter how you try to deny them. But do you ACT upon those desires? We all have one life, my friend. And what use that life if not lived to the fullest? Will you really care what people think when you “pass” ? (i.e. if you did something that is SSC, really, really like, something you really, really WANT – nay- CRAVE) – who cares?) Most people “live lives of quiet desperation”, as the great Thoreau once said … And they rarely, if ever, bring out their innermost thoughts, dreams and desires, like I do – publicly! And I’ve never been happier. So will YOU, my friend, so will YOU – once you do what Colonel Trautman told Rambo in First Blood Part III i.e. “accept the inner you”. It’s YOU. And thats what matters! And this treatise, well, if you’ve been having thoughts of “oh, I should not be thinking that way”, or guilt trips etc as I once did about wanting so desperately to be a sissy – well, this treatise will BANISH all such thoughts instantly. Indeed, my writing is not just so erotic – not just so unique (nothing like our stuff out there!) – but most importantly, so REAL life, and NO or very little creative license, despite a life SO full most can’t believe it! – that you too will be inspired to take the sissy BULL by the horns – or penis – and just (beg to) DO! And that, probably more than anything is why I wrote this book! More benefits? Well, for you sissies and faggots (wanna be or not) reading this … What you think about – is indeed what you ATTRACT, except most people dont think about it the right way. And thats #1 right at the top – learn how to THINK the right way – this is something I teach in ALL my courses! If you’re thinking something – chances are excellent or second to none that if you do with deep EMOTION – it will happen! Learn just how in terms of BDSM, sissydom, and so forth You’ll learn after reading this book why HONEST and open is truly what women like – not so much “your preferences” as a sissy … Why NOT being able to control your ejaculation – or staying hard is not just a matter of PRIDE for sissies, but a level every sissy should aspire to ATTAIN to, or the other way around! Why cumming in one’s pants, often involuntarily, is the greatest HONOR any sissy could ever be afforded! And why even sissies that are GOOD in bed with their penis should try NOT TO BE – your TONGUE is what is needed! Why PENIS and penis love are often misunderstood, and why, as I stated so many times in my books, specially Cock Worship for Sissies and Faggots, and Penis Central, but one of them – loving PENIS is an absolute MUST – I repeat, absolute MUST – if you want to be a sissy at ANY decent level! Why you MUST aspire, as a sissy to get to the point where you think nothing but COCK – and feet – or feet – and COCK all day. And consequently, why you must aspire to hone your servitude skills better than anyone else out there – including the TIP of your tongue too if you get my drift! How – and why – and these tips will tell you – or these CONFESSIONS, you could call them tips as well! – to REWIRE your sexuality permanently so the above is ALL you think about – and attract (and trust me, just reading, do what I say, you’ll see) How to get more comfortable in your REAL skin as a sissy – like never before! The stunning similarity if done right between maledom – and femdom – and THIS alone is worth the price and ticket of admission for all reading this. What your TRUE first love – and “how it really happened” (and we all know, we’ve all had those experiences) teach you a LOT about who you TRULY are! (and your desires too). (but you’ll learn doublefold and more the real meaning of “true love”!). Why you must love his penis not just more than your own – thats a GIVEN – but why you must love his penis above ALL, why his PENIS should ultimately be the focal point you focus on, think of, everything, get to know his DONG better than your own FACE! – and why (and how) that will aid more than anything else in becoming the PERFECT SISSY! Even if you already love cock, learn how to fantasize about it to a point where that is ALL you think about, therefore, ATTRACT! Even if you aren’t really interested in being a sissy – a “dream sissy” – a perfect sissy – if youre just interested in tiltilating yourself without the visual porn, and REAL life “sissydom and fetish” – well, THIS book will do it! And much, much more. (by the way, Sissy Central (our most popular book) and Sissygasm Central are must reads along with THIS book!) For you DOMINANT ladies (or men) reading this … Here are some – I could write TOMES here too! Learn what your sissy REALLY wants deep down inside – chances are excellent and second to none and second to none just flew to Mars, not Venus, hehe – he (she) is NOT telling you! And even if she is, probably not all of it, probably not in graphic details, trust me, even me, at a certain point, I used to be so shy about all this! Learn how the MENTAL part of humiliation is really what gets sissies and yourself off, and how to take it to the DEEPEST levels possible via what is “explained” (and described) in these BASE, DEBASE, confessions! Learn why – well, two things – one LABELS (especially the “gay”, “straight” etc labels of so called sexuality which is VERY fluid and always shades of X and Y as I keep saying) are useless- and why these same labels when used right can take your submissive – and you – to levels of bliss youve never experienced before. Learn how you can EASILY get “straight men” to do things they would NEVER “dream of in their wildest dreams” (except they do. Hehe). Even if you arent that dominating – this book will MAKE you dominant, just by reading and understanding the utter lust behind some of the scenes, and the why’s and wherefore’s! Even if you weren’t interested in having a sissy before – you will now, and then some! Learn how to control your sissy with WORDS – this book perhaps explains the axiom of “it’s all about the mind” BETTER than anything else! And, its never about her body – or even his! Learn how external looks are basically always irrelevant – all my books teach you that – but this book teaches you more than anything else how sissies lust for COCK – and FOOT – all types, provided the MINDSET behind is devious, and uber dominant, and OPEN! (and “right” by extension!) . Learn how your having a cock – or even a foot – provided the mind is right – puts you ahead of the game automatically if you know how to USE it right! You’ll never feel so good about your body again, my friend, trust me! Learn how being slovenly is not just an excuse to be lazy – its a massive TURN on for your sissy! Learn the inner most secrets and how your sissy’s mind works, and how to use that to YOUR advantage. My significant other despite not being into BDSM has graduated from being a “simple small town girl” (like in Garima Madam … JI!) – to a “cuckoldress” and dominatrix (lifestyle) “el supreme”! Learn how body hair can be a HUGE turn on for sissies – FEMALES, you will LOVE THIS ONE, TRULY! Learn how to keep your sissy HORNY and on edge – read this with “15 ways to give him the ruined orgasm of his life … and have him SALIVATING for MORE!” … this alone is worth the price of admission. Perhaps the best part? Become the Queen – or King – you were always meant to be – in ALL areas of your life – not just sexual! The sheer CONFIDENCE you get from all this will be such a boost it will naturally permeate over into areas of your life you never thought before, like your work! And much, much more … And that, my friend is that. Yet another masterpiece (or mistress piece) from the Real Mc Coy of femdom and everything fetish related. And one you MUST have sitting on your mantelpiece, or hiding in the drawer, whichever the case might be. Here is but a SNEAK (just a peek, sissy! Hehe) PEEK at what you’ll GET – some of these writings will literally FORCE the dormant sissy out of you! Sissy Confessions, and one I’ll make to perfect Madam Megan tomorrow morning! Sissy Confession #2 – The almighty struggle NOT to cum in pant! Sissy Confession #3 – Dick and balls, my friend. Dick and balls! Sissy Confession #4 – First love, first COCK, first FOOT … Craven Depths of SUBMISSION – or perhaps sissy Confession #5 … Sissy Confessions #6– (Master Jerome’s) dangling dong! Sissy Confession #7 – More on feet – and COCK! Master’s long dong (schlong) – and I’m looking at it NOW – and Sissy confession #8! Sissy Confession #9 – I so love aggressive, dominant, BRATTY (naturally) Chinese women sTRIDING up to me, looking me in the EYE – and WHY! (not! Hehe) Sissy Confession #10 – When us submissive FREAKS call her Ma’am – and how she feels – and loves it – not – and yes! Sissy confession #11, Long thick DONGS, men shooting POWERFUL LONG LOADS – usually from thick STRAIGHT DONGS! Don’t cocks just have a way of making you forget ALL? (Sissy Confession #12, so NICE!) Sissy Confession #13 – Why sissy fags are often the best “born to suck” – at sucking – DONG! Sissy Confession #14 – The one “girlie” habit I never will/want to get rid of, and .. Sissy Confession #6! Sissy Confession #15 – On shining his dong, rigorously polishing his KNOB with SLOB – and more. Penis is just so NICE AND DOMINATING! Sissy Confession #17 – What Madam Megan didnt get about sissy, penis LOVE! Sissy Confession #18 – The effect his lovely long DONG has on me… Sissy Confession #19 I just can’t get his penis out of my mind! (and this is in a different color, rightfully so, my entire sissy self is so DEVOTED TO HIS DONG, MASTER IS SO MANLY, HIS COCK IS SO, SO, like Master Wang’s in Penis Central, SO NICE!)Oh, that cock HEAD, SIR ! PAYE LAGU, SIR, I’d kiss your feet – each toe 10 times, 100 times, all day, just to have your erect tubular LONG DONG in front of my NOSE – SO NICE! “His dick is really hard today!” (Sissy confession #20) Sissy Confession #21 – That was quite a load I pumped out last night! Sissy Confession #22 -That HEAVENLY LOAD of REAL MAN CUM! Sissy Confession #23 – Sissy Cum Dump Sissy Confession #24 – Madam, I’d kiss your dream man’s feet and suck his cock if you wanted me to . . . all for YOU! Sissy Confession #25- How Master Wangs dense, thick pubes drove me NOSE deep into levels of hitherto unfelt LUST! Sissy Confession #26 – How perfect Master Wang turned me so expertly (without trying) into the piss drinking sissy I am, always WAS! And so love to be! Sissy Confession #27 – What Master Wang taught me about my TRUE self without even trying… Master Wang stuck his lovely tongue out!! And it drove me insane with sheer utter LUST! (Sissy Confession #28) Sissy Confession #29 – Master Wang, your long lovely cock is so … NICE! Sissy Confession #30 – My highness, my lord, My MASTER, my OWNER, perfect Master Wang… Sissy Confession #31 – ABJECT, CRAVEN HUMILIATION THAT MAKES ME SHIVER WITH LUST. Malik, PAYE LAGU!

A Celebration of Humanism & Freethought,A Peculiar Humanism,David Williams,William E. Wiethoff,1995,2010,,"9780820336329, 0820336327",,264,,"In early-nineteenth-century America, and especially in the Old South, the use of oratory appealed to legal professionals--judges as well as advocates. Consistent with the humanism proclaimed in classical and neoclassical works, appellate judges perceived their civic duties to demand oratorical skill as well as legal expertise. In A Peculiar Humanism, William E. Wiethoff assesses the judicial use of oratory in reviewing slave cases and the struggle to fashion a humanist jurisprudence on slavery despite the customary restraints placed on judicial advocacy. Drawing attention to a neglected intersection of law and letters, Wiethoff analyzes the proslavery discourse embedded in antebellum judicial opinions by examining the public addresses, judicial narratives, and private papers of sixty-nine appellate judges. By contrasting the judges' proslavery appeals in a variety of cases in the upper and deep South, Wiethoff shows how context shaped the judges' perceptions, priorities, and arguments. An outstanding contribution to the literature on law and slavery, A Peculiar Humanism testifies to the character of the legal profession in the Old South and serves as an index of the beliefs and attitudes that coexisted with legal decision making.",,University of Georgia Press,Humanism,Law,,101548,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Fxnp1DU0-WMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,23.21,GoogleBooks

It teaches us how to recognise and interpret the life-changing messages from loved ones and spirit guides, by a renowned psychic medium. Laura Lynne Jackson is a psychic medium and the author of the New York Times bestseller The Light Between Us. She possesses an incredible gift: the ability to communicate with loved ones who have passed, convey messages of love and healing, and impart a greater understanding of our interconnectedness. Though her abilities are exceptional, they are not unique, and that is the message at the core of this book. Understanding 'the secret language of the universe' is a gift available to all. As we learn to ask for and recognise signs from the other side, we will start to find meaning where before there was only confusion, and see light in the darkness. We may decide to change paths, push toward love, pursue joy, and engage with life in a whole new way. In Signs, Jackson is able to bring the mystical into the everyday. She relates stories of people who have experienced uncanny revelations and instances of unexplained synchronicity, as well as others drawn from her own experience. There's the lost child who appears to her mother as a deer that approaches her unhesitatingly at a highway rest stop; the name written on a dollar bill that lets a terrified wife know that her husband will be okay; the Elvis Presley song that arrives at the exact moment of Jackson's own father's passing; and many others.

Yet from the 1850s until his death in 1895, Huxley always defined himself as a 'man of science', a moral and religious figure, not a scientist. Exploring his relationships with his wife, fellow naturalists, clergymen and men of letters, White presents a new analysis of the authority of science, literature, and religion during the Victorian period, showing how these different practices were woven into a fabric of high culture, and integrated into institutions of print, education and research.

This book is a great systematic theology starter for new believers yet still has so much theology that it will quickly become a quick reference resource for many mature Christians. This book is organized so that any reader can quickly get answers they might need when looking for answers to theological questions.

Spinoza. De Benedict: Descartes Rene,Spinoza and the Freedom of Philosophizing,Britannica Encyclopedia,Mogens Lærke,1952,2021-02-25,,"9780192648723, 0192648721",,341,The geometry of ethics,"Spinoza and the Freedom of Philosophizing is a study of freedom of speech, good government, civic responsibility, public education, and the foundations of religion and society, as seen through the eyes of seventeenth-century Dutch philosopher Spinoza. During the Golden Age of the Dutch Republic, a new kind of public sphere emerged. Courtly structures of political advice made room for new, republican forms of public consultation between the sovereign powers and the general citizenry. Missing, however, were guidelines for how and when to address questions of public concern and how to form unprejudiced citizens in possession of their own free judgment, capable of speaking up for themselves in public deliberations with the common interest in view. The book argues that Spinoza's conception of the freedom of philosophizing, and the systematic political theory he developed to defend it in his 1670 Theological-Political Treatise, were conceived to provide just such guidelines. It shows how Spinoza understood the freedom of philosophizing as a collective style of reasoning and argument based on mutual teaching and advising, a model for the public sphere in a free republic. It studies the conditions under which such a public sphere of free philosophizing could flourish, how it would require popular reform of public education and democratic reorganization of the relations between political counsel and sovereign command. It also shows how Spinoza designed theological and political doctrines of universal faith and social contract in order to promote true religion and a sense of civic duty, and asserted the state's right over sacred matters as a means to ensure mutual toleration in a multi-religious society.",Published with the Editorial advice of the faculties of the University of Chicago,Oxford University Press,,Philosophy,,100549,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XeAeEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,22.01,GoogleBooks

Spend twenty minutes on the freeway or ten minutes reading the newspaper, or ponder the religious and political conflicts in some regions of the world, and you will understand the point. Yet if people are to thrive--to live fully and together in peace-- we must have sanity when it comes to society. And that requires sanity when it comes to thinking about man. Sanity involves seeing things as they really are. Social sanity requires seeing man as he really is--to grasp who and what human beings are and what sort of social arrangements help or hinder human flourishing. In this classic work, Society and Sanity, Catholic thinker Frank Sheed brings his brilliant mind and lucid writing style to bear on the good human society. By explaining perennial truths about human nature based on the wisdom of Catholic social ethics, Sheed's book is as pertinent today with our controversies about love, the nature of marriage, the role of government, the relationship of law and morality and of Church and State, and the duties of the citizen, as when he penned the work over a half a century ago.",Dodd Mead,Ignatius Press,Sex,Religion,Hardback,101223,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5eIrZPANPRIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,22,GoogleBooks

Jennifer Neal was born in the United States to a family that moved continuously for their own survival and well-being—from the Great Migration to the twenty-first century. As an adult, she has continued to travel the world as a Black queer woman, across two decades and four countries—from Japan to the US and then Australia to Germany, where she has settled for now. Throughout her moves, Neal threads her personal story of immigration with local Black histories and racial politics to provide context for her own experiences. The result is both a crucial examination of how racism plays a foundational role in modern-day immigration systems and a tender tribute to immigrants and their stories. An unwavering interrogation of colonialism and policy, love and loss, hypocrisy and resistance, My Pisces Heart demands meaningful conversation about not only the ways in which we live with our histories, but also how they live through us—urging an honest dialogue on why the West continues to grapple with its past and visualize its future.",Freethought Press N.

Cody’s An Apostle of the North, originally published in 1908, captures perfectly the zeal of the 19th century missionary and tells the story of a man called to do God’s work in the Diocese of Athabasca in the most northern regions of Canada. Bishop William Carpenter Bompas was a difficult man, cantankerous, stubborn, and more than a little eccentric. He carried on his shoulders the deep spirituality of his own faith, the assumptions of his background, and the cultural aggressiveness of the Victorian age. He was a church leader who often disagreed with his church and ignored its advice. Bompas’s life in the North offers insights into the compelling force of religion and faith, one of the most pervasive forces in human experience, capable of transforming people, creating conflict, spreading hope, motivating entire nations, and, as history has shown, making horrible and damaging mistakes. In a new Introduction, historians William Morrison and Ken Coates examine Bompas’s career, exploring themes central to the history of the church in Canada and to aboriginal-newcomer relations.",Published with the Editorial advice of the faculties of the University of Chicago,University of Alberta,,Biography & Autobiography,,102459,,Reference,,21.9,GoogleBooks

Life Story of Alf Ferguson: member of the Association,Geologic Life,Alf Ferguson,Kathryn Yusoff,1977,2024-03-18,,"9781478059288, 1478059281",,384,,"In Geologic Life, Kathryn Yusoff theorizes the processes by which race and racialization emerged geologically. Examining both the history of geology as a discipline and ongoing mineral and resource extraction, Yusoff locates forms of imperial geology embedded in Western and Enlightenment thought and highlights how it creates anti-Black, anti-Indigenous, and anti-Brown environmental and racial injustices. Throughout, she outlines how the disciplines of geology and geography---and their conventions: surveying, identifying, classifying, valuing, and extracting—established and perpetuated colonial practices that ordered the world and people along a racial axis. Examining the conceptualization of the inhuman as political, geophysical, and paleontological, Yusoff unearths an apartheid of materiality as distinct geospatial forms. This colonial practice of geology organized and underpinned racialized accounts of space and time in ways that materially made Anthropocene Earth. At the same time, Yusoff turns to Caribbean, Indigenous, and Black thought to chart a parallel geologic epistemology of the ""earth-bound"" that challenges what and who the humanities have chosen to overlook in its stories of the earth. By reconsidering the material epistemologies of the earth as an on-going geotrauma in colonial afterlives, Yusoff demonstrates that race is as much a geological formation as a biological one.",,Duke University Press,Autobiography,Social Science,,104675,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Xoz7EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,21.47,GoogleBooks

The Miracle of Theism,The Legitimacy of Miracle,J. L. Mackie,Robert A. Larmer,1990,2013-11-05,,"9780739184226, 0739184229",268,229,,"The core contention of The Legitimacy of Miracle is that a priori philosophical dismissals of the possibility or probability of justified belief in miracles fail. Whether or not it is rational to believe that events best understood as miracles actually occur is not to be decided on the basis of armchair theorizing, but rather on the basis of meticulous examination of the evidence. Such examination, however, needs to be set free from unwarranted assumptions that miracles are “impossible, improbable, or improper.” Philosophical analysis can play an important role in clearing away conceptual underbrush and question-begging presuppositions, but it cannot take the place of detailed consideration of historical and contemporary evidence. Robert Larmer demonstrates that the proper role of philosophy, as regards to the belief in miracles, is to provide an in-principle rejection of in-principle arguments either for or against. The arguments contained in this book will be of particular interest to students and scholars of philosophy, theology, history, and religious studies, though it is written in a style accessible to anyone interested in a philosophical examination of belief in miracles.",Clarendon Press Oxford,Lexington Books,Philosophy / Religion,Philosophy,Paperback,102029,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QTEKAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,21.43,GoogleBooks

It illuminates the fundamental ways in which a culture is formed, while highlighting important features of the Irish narrative tradition, in all its wealth and variety and in its connections with the mythical and historical events of Ireland. The Irish Fairy Tale argues that the fairy tale is a kind of “neutral zone,” a place of transition as well as a meeting place for popular beliefs and individual creativity, oral tradition and literary works, historical sources and imaginary reconstructions, and for contrasting and converging views of the world, which altogether allow for a deeper and more sophisticated understanding of reality. The book focuses on stories by Yeats and Stephens, whose approach to the subject marks the culmination of a long tradition of attempts at linking past and present and of bridging the gap between what appear to be contradictory facets of a single culture. This leads to a comparative study of Joyce’s Dubliners, which illustrates the universal and exemplary nature of the notion of fairy tale put forward in the work.",Beacon Press,Rowman & Littlefield,Catholicism,Literary Criticism,,104154,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=D2EHqpSLy-cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,20.62,GoogleBooks

Unabridged (100% Original content) Font adjustments & biography included Illustrated About Candide by Voltaire Candide is a French satire first published in 1759 by Voltaire, a philosopher of the Age of Enlightenment. The novella has been widely translated, with English versions titled Candide: or, All for the Best (1759); Candide: or, The Optimist (1762); and Candide: or, Optimism (1947). It begins with a young man, Candide, who is living a sheltered life in an Edenic paradise and being indoctrinated with Leibnizian optimism (or simply ""optimism"") by his mentor, Professor Pangloss. The work describes the abrupt cessation of this lifestyle, followed by Candide's slow, painful disillusionment as he witnesses and experiences great hardships in the world. Voltaire concludes with Candide, if not rejecting optimism outright, advocating a deeply practical precept, ""we must cultivate our garden"", in lieu of the Leibnizian mantra of Pangloss, ""all is for the best"" in the ""best of all possible worlds"". Candide is characterised by its sarcastic tone as well as by its erratic, fantastical and fast-moving plot. A picaresque novel with a story similar to that of a more serious Bildungsroman, it parodies many adventure and romance clichés, the struggles of which are caricatured in a tone that is mordantly matter-of-fact. Still, the events discussed are often based on historical happenings, such as the Seven Years' War and the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.[8] As philosophers of Voltaire's day contended with the problem of evil, so too does Candide in this short novel, albeit more directly and humorously. Voltaire ridicules religion, theologians, governments, armies, philosophies, and philosophers through allegory; most conspicuously, he assaults Leibniz and his optimism.",Watts & Co.,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,Biography / Voltaire,,Hardback,103491,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=i890vgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,20.54,GoogleBooks

The Many Lives of a Rajput Queen explores how early modern regional elites, caste groups, and mystical and monastic communities shaped their distinctive versions of the past through the repeated refashioning of the legend of Padmini. Ramya Sreenivasan investigates these legends and traces their subsequent appropriation by colonial administrators and nationalist intellectuals, for varying different political ends. Using Padmini as a means of illustrating the power of gender norms in constructing heroic memory, she shows how such narratives about virtuous women changed as they circulated across particular communities in South Asia between the sixteenth and early twentieth centuries. This book will interest historians of memory, gender, community, culture, and historywriting in South Asia.

Theology and Meaning: A Critique of Metetheological Scepticism,CHRISTIAN THEOLOGY,Raeburne Seely Heimbeck,Edward D. Andrews,1969,2024-01-26,,9798877567801,269,521,,"""CHRISTIAN THEOLOGY: The Christian's Ultimate Guide to Learning from the Bible"" is a comprehensive exploration of Christian doctrine, offering an in-depth understanding of the essential teachings and principles of the faith. This extensive work is an invaluable resource for both seasoned theologians and those new to biblical study. In this meticulously crafted volume, readers will delve into the essence of Christianity, examining the dynamics of faith that form the bedrock of Christian belief. The book begins with a profound introduction to the core tenets of Christianity, laying a solid foundation for the intricate theological concepts that follow. The journey continues through the complex realm of biblical doctrine, where divine revelation, the process of inspiration, the inerrancy of Scripture, and the formation of the canon are examined with scholarly precision. Principles of biblical interpretation are explored in detail, providing readers with the tools to understand Scripture within its historical and cultural context. A significant portion of the book is dedicated to the Doctrine of God, delving into His identity, divine attributes, and the enigmatic nature of the Trinity. The book also illuminates God's law and His active role in the world, offering insightful perspectives on His interactions with humanity. The Doctrine of Christ receives thorough attention, exploring Christ's eternal existence, His miraculous birth, sinless nature, and the profound significance of the crucifixion, atonement, resurrection, and ascension. The ongoing role of Christ in heaven is also examined, highlighting His enduring influence in the Christian faith. The Holy Spirit's doctrine is not overlooked, with chapters dedicated to understanding His work, indwelling, and active role today. The Human Doctrine follows, offering an exploration of the creation of humanity, the concept of being made in God’s image, and the descent into sin. In the Doctrine of Redemption, readers will find an in-depth analysis of atonement, ransom, reconciliation, sanctification, and the multifaceted nature of salvation, including perspectives from Calvinism, Reformed Calvinism, and Arminianism. The book also ventures into Angelology, providing insights into the nature of angels and the roles of key archangels like Michael and Gabriel. The Doctrine of Satan and Demonology are addressed, shedding light on the essence, strategies, and realm of demonic forces. Ecclesiology is explored in depth, covering the origins, essence, and functions of the Church, the significance of church membership, and the dynamics of church leadership, along with an examination of first-century church administration as a model for today. Finally, the book culminates in a detailed study of Eschatology—the Doctrine of the End Times.

Crime and Religion,Worship and Sin,Joseph McCabe,Karel Kurst-Swanger,1954,2008,,"0820463876, 9780820463872",64,290,,"Worship and Sin: Religion-Related Crime in the United States raises provocative questions about the role of religion in crime and criminal behavior. Arguing that religion-related crime should be classified as a distinct subset of crime worthy of continued investigation by scholars, this book brings together for the first time the disparate scholarly research related to various types of religion-related crime, presents numerous examples, and considers the practical and legal issues facing practitioners of various disciplines. This ground-breaking work takes great care to present a comprehensive overview of the phenomenon and illustrates the complex and multidimensional nature of this crime category. A three-pronged typology is presented as a conceptual framework to distinguish the unique features of different types of religion-related crime and to highlight the dynamic historical, psychological, social, and cultural forces involved in each. The author opens the text with several introductory chapters which serve to define religion-related crime, explore the role of religion in society, and to provide an overview of legal and policy issues. The remaining chapters provide detailed examples of three different types of religion-related crime: theologically-based crimes, which are those which are a result of a particular religious custom, practice, or belief; while reactive/defensive crimes are those which come about more as a result of social or political tensions between the religious member or group and the broader secular community. The third type of religion-related crime identified is the abuse of religious authority. This category explores crimes committed by clergy who have taken advantage of their social, political, and religious status. To further broaden an understanding of religion-related crime, the author provides chapters which explore crimes against women and children, the use of illicit drugs in religious practice or to reach desired states of spiritual awareness, the nature and function of destructive religious groups, violence against reproductive health providers, hate crime, and crimes committed by clergy.",Progressive World,Peter Lang,Crime / Religion,Business & Economics,Paperback,102118,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9N7nPf_0ePUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,19.23,GoogleBooks

Fritzsche’s insightful introduction presents valuable historical, biographical, and cultural guidelines for exploring Nietzsche’s ideas and influence, without ignoring his literary acumen. The samples of Nietzsche’s writing were carefully chosen to represent Nietzsche’s enduring relevance for contemporary life. With “the death of God” as his starting point, Fritzsche selected and translated documents from the full range of Nietzsche’s explosive writings to expose readers to key ideas he developed. His bold concepts ignited reactions in his time and continue to energize and shape worldviews. Selections include Nietzsche’s thoughts on such topics as how humans have fallen into a subordinate relationship with systems of morality of their own making, and the importance of recognizing new possibilities; how different cultures and languages enable unique interpretations—that is, there is no common or real world; and how the “slave mentality” of the West inclines people to see each other as victims instead of masters of their own lives. All of the documents feature notations about publication history and context for the readings that follow; gloss notes explain literary allusions, historical references, and unfamiliar terms; appendixes include a chronology of Nietzsche’s life, questions for consideration, and a bibliography of selected works by and about Nietzsche.",Henry Regnery Company,Waveland Press,Antichristianity,History,,106181,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MoBIAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,17.71,GoogleBooks

But in the 21st century, there are new dangers—new teachers who threaten to do more damage than the last. These are not obscure teachers that Hanegraaff unmasks. We know their names. We have seen their faces, sat in their churches, and heard them shamelessly preach and promote the false pretexts of a give-to-get gospel. They are virtual rock stars who command the attention of presidential candidates and media moguls. Through make-believe miracles, urban legends, counterfeit Christs, and twisted theological reasoning, they peddle an occult brand of metaphysics that continues to shipwreck the faith of millions around the globe: “God cannot do anything in this earthly realm unless we give Him permission.” “Keep saying it—‘I have equality with God’—talk yourself into it.” “Being poor is a sin.” “The Jews were not rejecting Jesus as Messiah; it was Jesus who was refusing to be the Messiah to the Jews!” “You create your own world the same way God creates His. He speaks, and things happen; you speak, and they happen.” Christianity in Crisis: 21st Century exposes darkness to light, pointing us back to a Christianity centered in Christ. From the Preface: “Having lost the ability to think biblically, postmodern Christians are being transformed from cultural change agents and initiators into cultural conformists and imitators. Pop culture beckons, and postmodern Christians have taken the bait. As a result, the biblical model of faith has given way to an increasingly bizarre array of fads and formulas.”",Watts & Co,HarperChristian + ORM,Freethought,Religion,Hardback,100668,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nIZqm-1gQgYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,17.5,GoogleBooks

The story revolves around Prince Lef Nicolaievitch Muishkin, a young man returning to Russia after spending several years in a Swiss sanatorium for epilepsy. Through the prince, Dostoevsky explores themes of innocence, social dynamics, and the clash between idealism and the harsh realities of life. At the start of the novel, the prince is introduced on a train coming into St. Petersburg, where he meets fellow passengers who engage in conversation about their circumstances and backgrounds. Notably, he encounters Rogojin, a passionate and wealthy man who seems to have a deep interest in a beautiful woman named Nastasia Philipovna. The narrative begins to hint at complex relationships, societal expectations, and Muishkin's unique perspective on life shaped by his illness and previous isolation. The opening chapters set a stage rich with contrasts between characters and unveil the future pivotal role that love and tragedy will play in the lives of these individuals.",Published with the Editorial advice of the faculties of the University of Chicago,,,Fiction,,100992,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3-X_0AEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,16.69,GoogleBooks

This era is inundated with famous names (Da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael, Petrarch, Machiavelli, Cervantes, and Shakespeare), and the heritage it left can hardly be overestimated. The A to Z of the Renaissance provides information on these fields through its chronology, which traces events from 1250 to 1648, and its introduction delineating the underlying features of the period.

Ecclesiastical & civil","Machiavelli is usually understood as a thinker who separated morality from politics or who championed Roman, pagan morality over conventional, Christian morality. Belliotti argues, instead, that Machiavelli's innovation is his understanding of the perhaps irresolvable moral conflicts that exist within political leaders who fulfill the duties of their offices while accepting the authority of absolute moral principles. Machiavelli is a moral pessimist who insists that politicians must 'risk their souls' when performing their public responsibilities. Politicians and military leaders must dirty their hands in service to their constituents. This is especially the case when one strong man founds a state or reforms a corrupt state. History washes away_that is, excuses_many of the horrifying deeds that are required in such cases. Belliotti does not try to domesticate Machiavelli by picturing him as a liberal humanist inclined only toward free government. Nor does he paint him as a teacher of evil. Instead, the book offers a balanced understanding of the Florentine, with special focus on his insights and his myopias. Machiavelli's view of human nature and his conclusion that international affairs have always been and will always be a series of zero-sum contests lead him to stunning discoveries and glaring errors alike.",Published with the Editorial advice of the faculties of the University of Chicago,Lexington Books,,Philosophy,,101741,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VVLGaSkV6l4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,15.76,GoogleBooks

Written between 1787 and 1788 by three of the “Founding Fathers” of the United States, the Papers were written with the specific intention of convincing Americans that it was in their interest to back the creation of a strong national government, enshrined in a constitution – and they played a major role in deciding the debate between proponents of a federal state, with its government based on central institutions housed in a single capital, and the supporters of states’ rights. The papers’ authors – Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay – believed that centralised government was the only way to knit their newborn country together, while still preserving individual liberties. Closely involved with the politics of the time, they saw a real danger of America splintering, to the detriment of all its citizens. Given the fierce debates of the time, however, Hamilton, Jay and Madison knew they had to persuade the general public by advancing clear, well-structured arguments – and by systematically engaging with opposing points of view. By enshrining checks and balances in a constitution designed to protect individual liberties, they argued, fears that central government would oppress the newly free people of America would be allayed.

Within weeks it became the most hotly debated topic, with Dawkins himself branded as either saint or sinner for presenting his hard-hitting, impassioned rebuttal of religion of all types. His argument could hardly be more topical. While Europe is becoming increasingly secularized, the rise of religious fundamentalism, whether in the Middle East or Middle America, is dramatically and dangerously dividing opinion around the world. In America, and elsewhere, a vigorous dispute between 'intelligent design' and Darwinism is seriously undermining and restricting the teaching of science. In many countries religious dogma from medieval times still serves to abuse basic human rights such as women's and gay rights. And all from a belief in a God whose existence lacks evidence of any kind. Dawkins attacks God in all his forms. He eviscerates the major arguments for religion and demonstrates the supreme improbability of a supreme being. He shows how religion fuels war, foments bigotry and abuses children.

Infallible,Nae-Née,Hans Kung,Stephanie C. Fox,1971,2014-01-18,,,,394,Translated by Erich Mosbacher,"Nae-Née is a dystopian science fiction story. It is a cautionary tale of a loss of liberty along with our ecosystem. It takes place in the present. Nae-Née posits a world not unlike our own, as it confronts the major taboo of our time: the conflict between human overpopulation and the human desire to pass on one’s DNA and culture, and to rest assured that the next generation will care for the previous one and continue all that matters to it. Our planet’s ecosystem is being stressed past capacity to the brink of collapse due to biodiversity loss, rising sea levels, floods, droughts, overdependence on fossil fuels, and the climate changes that drive all that. In short, the human species is in dire trouble due to overpopulation – its own. No one seems remotely inclined to sacrifice any comfort or control over their habits in order to save the environment and ultimately their own future existence, happiness or sense of purpose. But there is a significant difference: nanite technology has advanced sufficiently to be of actual, practical use to physicians and scientists. Nae-Née is a safe, reliable, user-friendly form of birth control. It is a microscopic device made of nanites – little robots. It contains a life-time supply of super-concentrated RU486, which the device releases whenever it detects a rise in hormones that indicates a fertilized embryo is about to implant itself. All that the inventors – a husband-and-wife team – wanted was a convenient device that would prevent pregnancy every time without constantly pumping a woman’s body full of artificial hormones. Its name literally translates as “not born” and was chosen by Avril, the wife, to reflect her husband’s Scottish background and her own French ancestry. The story is told from Avril's point of view, a woman with Asperger's and a professor of women's medical history. The world’s leaders have decided to make it the duty of every human being to participate in a bold new world policy, and they have drafted a treaty at the United Nations, and every nation has agreed to sign onto it.

In recent times, investigations into colour vision have been one of the main success stories of cognitive science, for each discipline within the field - neuroscience, psychology, linguistics, computer science and artificial intelligence, and philosophy - has contributed significantly to our understanding of colour. Evan Thompson's book is a major contribution to this interdisciplinary project. Colour Vision provides an accessible review of the current scientific and philosophical discussions of colour vision. Thompson steers a course between the subjective and objective positions on colour, arguing for a relational account. This account develops a novel `ecological' approach to colour vision in cognitive science and the philosophy of perception.

For the last half-century this relationship has been described, ultimately, as parasitic. As a result, Coleridge's contribution to religious thought has been seen primarily in terms of his poetic genius. This book revives and deepens the evaluation of Coleridge as a philosophical theologian in his own right. Coleridge had a critical and creative relation to, and kinship with, German Idealism. Moreover, the principal impulse behind his engagement with that philosophy is traced to the more immediate context of English Unitarian-Trinitarian controversy of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The book re-establishes Coleridge as a philosopher of religion and as a vital source for contemporary theological reflection.",longman Group Lmtd,Cambridge University Press,Theology,Religion,,104828,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EO8l1xv8xskC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,13.56,GoogleBooks

Even so, Dr. Pomar has helped many to come to their own conclusions about the validity of this technique. Now, she guides readers on using her techniques to live more fully or mold their destinies. She also discusses theories on why and how past-life regression is possible. If you've ever struggled with how the possibility of past-life regression fits within your faith, Dr. Pomar off ers advice on how to evaluate your conflict. If you are a regressionist, Dr. Pomar's work can help you realize that by helping your client, you also help past and future generations as well.

Bringing together leading scholars in the field, the contributors to this volume provide us with thoughtful and fruitful ways of thinking about a number of contemporary and long-standing arenas of work where both established and more recent researchers are engaged.

Commentators and theorists have variously seen fashion as a social, economic or aesthetic force, or sometimes as all three at once. Fashion helps to form our individual identities and lets us stand out from the crowd. Fashion appears to be novel. At the same time it preserves the status quo: it makes us think that change is occurring when the opposite is closer to the truth. After a Fashion investigates the different sides of this hybrid phenomenon. Joanne Finkelstein considers fashion in its various guises-as body decoration and costume, as a language and form of irrational play, as an expression of sexuality and part of the urban experience. Drawing on economics, art psychology, commerce, history and the everyday, she traces and analyses the multiple influences that, in the name of fashion, affect the ways we think and act.",,Simon and Schuster,,Social Science,,101420,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HmxDEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,12.23,GoogleBooks

Joe Biden was elected president in part on the promise of setting us on a science-driven course correction, but, a little more than a year later, another half-a-million Americans were killed by the virus. What happened? In The Fault in Our SARS, evolutionary epidemiologist Rob Wallace catalogs the Biden administration's failures in controlling the outbreak. He also shows that, beyond matters of specific political persona or party, it was a decades-long structural decline associated with putting profits ahead of people that gutted U.S. public health. COVID-19 isn’t just an American tragedy. Each in its own way, countries around the world following the ""profit-first"" model failed their people. Global vaccination campaigns were bottled up by efforts to protect pharmaceutical companies' intellectual property rights. Economies were treated as somehow more real than the people and ecologies upon which they depend. Frustrated populations pushed back against lockdowns, abuses of governmental trust, and, fair or not, the very concept of public health. A social rot meanwhile wended its way into the heart of the sciences that, tasked with controlling disease, serve the systems that helped bring about COVID-19 in the first place. In The Fault in Our SARS, Wallace and an array of invited contributors aim to strip down the capitalist social psychology that in effect protected the SARS virus. The team proposes instead new approaches in health and ecology that appeal both to humanity's highest ideals and the pragmatic changes we must make to survive COVID and the worst of the new diseases on the horizon.",Watts & Co.,NYU Press,Chemistry,Medical,Hardback,100709,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mn5nEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,10.57,GoogleBooks

It explores dominant cultural narratives around what makes a “good” female virginity loss experience by examining two key forms of popular literature: autobiographical virginity loss stories and popular romance fiction. In particular, this book focuses on how female sexual desire and romantic love have become entangled in the contemporary cultural imagination, leading to the emergence of a dominant paradigm which dictates that for women, sexual desire and love are and should be intrinsically linked together: something which has greatly affected cultural scripts for virginity loss. This book examines the ways in which this paradigm has been negotiated, upheld, subverted, and resisted in depictions of virginity loss in popular literatures, unpacking the romanticisation of the idea of “the right one” and “the right time”.",,Springer Nature,,Literary Criticism,,104523,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YV35DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,10.53,GoogleBooks

Mikalson,2000,2014-03-19,,"9781469617183, 1469617188",,376,,"In Honor Thy Gods Jon Mikalson uses the tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides to explore popular religious beliefs and practices of Athenians in the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. and examines how these playwrights portrayed, manipulated, and otherwise represented popular religion in their plays. He discusses the central role of honor in ancient Athenian piety and shows that the values of popular piety are not only reflected but also reaffirmed in tragedies. Mikalson begins by examining what tragic characters and choruses have to say about the nature of the gods and their intervention in human affairs. Then, by tracing the fortunes of diverse characters -- among them Creon and Antigone, Ajax and Odysseus, Hippolytus, Pentheus, and even Athens and Troy -- he shows that in tragedy those who violate or challenge contemporary popular religious beliefs suffer, while those who support these beliefs are rewarded. The beliefs considered in Mikalson's analysis include Athenians' views on matters regarding asylum, the roles of guests and hosts, oaths, the various forms of divination, health and healing, sacrifice, pollution, the religious responsibilities of parents, children, and citizens, homicide, the dead, and the afterlife. After summarizing the vairous forms of piety and impiety related to these beliefs found in the tragedies, Mikalson isolates ""honoring the gods"" as the fundamental concept of Greek piety. He concludes by describing the different relationships of the three tragedians to the religion of their time and their audience, arguing that the tragedies of Euripides most consistently support the values of popular religion.",,UNC Press Books,Christianity,History,,101290,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ML-iAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,10.42,GoogleBooks

It is a land of enchantment, legendary for its natural beauty and rich cultural heritage. But it is also a land of paradox. In America, New Mexico, Robert Leonard Reid explores deep inside New Mexico's landscape to find the real New Mexico—with all of its gifts and challenges—within. Having traveled and hiked countless miles throughout the state, Reid knows New Mexico's breathtaking landscape intimately. But he knows the human landscape as well: its artists and poets, medicine men and businessmen, preachers and politicians, Hispanics and Anglos. He knows that amid the glittering mansions of Santa Fe there are homeless shelters, that the Indians of myth and legend combat alcoholism and poverty, and that toxic waste lurks beneath a land of almost surreal beauty. America, New Mexico is a book about land, sky, and hope by a writer whose passion and inspiring prose invite us to see the promise and possibilities of reconnecting with the natural world. It is unflinching in its depiction of the adversities facing New Mexicans and indeed all Americans. But above all, it searches behind and beyond these troubling issues to find, standing staunchly against them, a quiet and unshakable confidence rooted in New Mexico's natural world. For anyone who has ever been moved by the incomparable beauty of New Mexico, for anyone concerned with the landscape in which all Americans live, America, New Mexico is an unforgettable book.",Robert Appelton Company New York,University of Arizona Press,Encyclopedia / Catholic,Travel,,100785,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=I-nTZi4N6hIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,7.82,GoogleBooks

It speaks powerfully to believers as well as nonbelievers because it addresses the question of the meaning of life in the most satisfying way. The heart of this book is an expositional commentary that interprets Ecclesiastes as authoritative Scripture. It seeks to recover the rhetoric of the speech in terms of its comprehensive message on the meaning of life as well as its compelling force to get the message across. Preceding the expositional commentary is an introduction to Ecclesiastes that presents a new approach to outlining and reading Ecclesiastes as a coherent speech. It also presents an overview of the “forest”—the overall rhetorical flow of the speech from beginning to end. This is to prevent one from getting lost when immersed in the “trees” of the expositional commentary. Following the expositional commentary are two topical studies to give Ecclesiastes the breadth and depth of coverage it deserves. The first is an interdisciplinary exposition on the meaning of life. The second is an interpretive essay to defend exegetically the interpretation of Ecclesiastes as a coherent speech.,,Wipf and Stock Publishers,,Religion,,102796,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YsWAEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,6.92,GoogleBooks

The implications of this research radically change our understanding of life. It shows that genes and DNA do not control our biology; that instead DNA is controlled by signals from outside the cell, including the energetic messages emanating from our positive and negative thoughts. Dr. Lipton's profoundly hopeful synthesis of the latest and best research in cell biology and quantum physics is being hailed as a breakthrough, showing that our bodies can be changed as we retrain our thinking.",,ReadHowYouWant.com,,Psychology,,104446,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=p6Pgi7b_ZCsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,5.8,GoogleBooks

But the part of his work that is most studied today is probably his writings in metaphysics, which have been the focus of particularly lively philosophical discussion in the last twenty years or so. Leibniz's writings in metaphysics contain one of the great classic systems of modern philosophy, but the system must be pieced together from a vast and miscellaneous array of manuscripts, letters, articles, and books, in a way that makes especially strenuous demands on scholarship. This book presents an in-depth interpretation of three important parts of Leibniz's metaphysics, thoroughly grounded in the texts as well as in philosophical analysis and critique. The three areas discussed are the metaphysical part of Leibniz's philosophy of logic, his essentially theological treatment of the central issues of ontology, and his theory of substance (the theory of monads).",,Oxford University Press,Skeptic,Philosophy,,106626,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=p8Z82g-sjaEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,4.95,GoogleBooks

But, as things are, the author would beg all those who worship a miraculous Christ without doubt and difficulty to pause here and read no further. The book is not intended for them; it is intended for those alone to whom it is dedicated, ""the doubters of this generation."" For there are some who feel drawn towards the worship of Christ by love and reverence, yet repelled by an apparently inextricable connection of the story of Christ with a miraculous element which, in their minds, throws a doubt over the whole of His acts, His doctrine, His character, and even His existence. Others, who worship Christ, worship Him insecurely and tremulously. They assume that their faith must rest on the basis of the Bible miracles; and at times they cannot quite suppress a thrill of doubt and terror lest some horrible discovery of fresh truth, resulting in the destruction of the miraculous element of the Bible, may impair their right to regard Christ as ""anything better than a mere man."" It is to these two classes—the would-be worshippers and the doubtful worshippers of Christ—that the following Letters are addressed by one who has for many years found peace and salvation in the worship of a nonmiraculous Christ.",Steele Roberts,DigiCat,Jesus,Nature,,102627,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pIB9EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,2.55,GoogleBooks

For the past ninety years, The Humanist Magazine and its predecessor The New Humanist have published the most profound and provocative humanist writing in America. This volume focuses on the first forty-five years of the magazine, from 1928 to 1973, and on the philosophical discussion that formed its heart. The work of thinkers as accomplished as Buckminster Fuller, Corliss Lamont, B. F. Skinner, Frank Lloyd Wright, Lucile Green, and Isaac Asimov is included, along with that of many others. Editor Charles Murn has organized the essays into eleven chapters, providing an overview of the evolution of humanist thinking in each area.

Memories,Ruin Memories,Julian Huxley,"Bjørnar Olsen, Þóra Pétursdóttir",1970,2014-04-24,,"9781317695790, 1317695798",296,608,,"Since the nineteenth century, mass-production, consumerism and cycles of material replacement have accelerated; increasingly larger amounts of things are increasingly victimized rapidly and made redundant. At the same time, processes of destruction have immensely intensified, although largely overlooked when compared to the research and social significance devoted to consumption and production. The outcome is a ruin landscape of derelict factories, closed shopping malls, overgrown bunkers and redundant mining towns; a ghostly world of decaying modern debris normally omitted from academic concerns and conventional histories. The archaeology of the recent or contemporary past has grown fast during the last decade. This development has been concurrent with a broader popular, artistic and scholarly interest in modern ruins in general. Ruin Memories explores how the ruins of modernity are conceived and assigned cultural value in contemporary academic and public discourses, reassesses the cultural and historical value of modern ruins and suggests possible means for reaffirming their cultural and historic significance. Crucial for this reassessment is a concern with decay and ruination, and with the role things play in expressing the neglected, unsuccessful and ineffable. Abandonment and ruination is usually understood negatively through the tropes of loss and deprivation; things are degraded and humiliated while the information, knowledge and memory embedded in them become lost along the way. Without even ignoring its many negative and traumatizing aspects, a main question addressed in this book is whether ruination also can be seen as an act of disclosure. If ruination disturbs the routinized and ready-to-hand, to what extent can it also be seen as a recovery of memory as exposing meanings and presences that perhaps are only possible to grasp at second hand when no longer immersed in their withdrawn and useful reality? Anybody interested in the archaeology of the contemporary past will find Ruin Memories an essential guide to the very latest theoretical research in this emerging field of archaeological thought.",George Allen & Unwin,Routledge,Biography,Social Science,Hardback,101642,,Lending,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fBRxAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,1.2,GoogleBooks

The work focuses on the major events which took place across the continent during those years. It was the euphoric sixties, a period when Africans celebrated the end of colonial rule. Most of the countries on the continent won independence in the sixties. But they were also turbulent years marked by conflict. Some of the most tragic events during those years include the Congo crisis – the assassination of Patrice Lumumba, the secession of Katanga province, civil unrest across the country and intervention by external forces which turned Congo into the bleeding heart of Africa. Another tragedy was the Nigerian civil war. There was also the Zanzibar revolution. The sixties were also a decade of military coups, and much more. Its complementary volume, Remembering the Sixties: An African Experience, addresses other subjects on some of the major events which took place during those years. The sixties stand out as some of the most important years in the history of post-colonial Africa. It is a decade that will never be forgotten, especially by those, including the author, who were there during those days.",Secker & Warburg,New Africa Press,Politics,Social Science,Hardback,100790,,Reference,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=X-zZAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,0.89,GoogleBooks
